He is one of the most talented quarterbacks of his time (if not ever) and is widely celebrated for his skills as an athlete. Over his impressive career, he has accumulated an eye-watering net worth. Still, he has also maintained a long-term relationship with Gisele Bündchen (until 2022, when the couple decided to split).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His marriage is his most well-known relationship, but there have been other women in Brady's life. We know what he is like on the field, but have you ever wondered what his life is like when he is not playing football? And what the woman in his life think of him?</p><h2 id=who-has-tom-brady-dated>Who Has Tom Brady Dated?</h2><p>Tom Brady's most famous relationship was with supermodel Gisele Bündchen, who he was married to from 2009 until the couple announced in 2022 that <a href=#>they would be getting a divorce</a>. The former couple share two children, Benjamin and Vivian. Brady also has an older child, Jack, who he shares with his ex, actress Bridget Moynahan (they dated between 2004 and 2006).</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen Renegotiate Their Prenup?</a></span></p><p>But aside from his baby mamas, Brady has had very few high-profile relationships with famous women. His history can be traced back to 2002 when he briefly dated Playboy playmate Layla Roberts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same year he was linked to actress Tara Reid (although she didn't have much to say about their time together other than they had kissed. She told the show Kylie and Jackie O he was "pretty good looking"). But what is he like to be with?</p><h2 id=what-have-tom-brady-39-s-girlfriends-said-about-him-as-a-partner>What Have Tom Brady's Girlfriends Said About Him As A Partner?</h2><p>Not all the women who have been with Tom Brady have chosen to speak about their time together, but the ones who have, have had pretty nice things to say about him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tom-brady-and-gisele-bundchen.jpg><p>It is also worth noting that the way he has spoken about some of his ex-girlfriends has been very positive. This includes Bridget Moynahan, <a href=#>who gave birth to their son in 2007 after they had already broken up</a>. Brady has been an involved dad, and the former couple have found a way to co-parent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tom Brady's Net Worth Will Be Much Smaller After His Divorce From Supermodel Gisele Bündchen</a></span></p><p>"Tom and I made a decision to raise a child together, and we both found partners that not only supported us in raising that child, but also loved our child as if he was their own," Moynahan told People in 2019. "I don't think you can ask for more than that. My son is surrounded by love and grandparents that go on forever, and it's all good."</p><p>Gisele Bündchen has also commented on her husband, and she had some positive things to say while they were married. And even before this, it was love at first sight for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I knew right way — the first time I saw him," she told Vogue in 2009. "We met through a friend. The moment I saw him, he smiled, and I was like, 'That is the most beautiful, charismatic smile I've ever seen!' We sat and talked for three hours. I had to go home for Christmas, but I didn't want to leave. You know that feeling of, like, you can't get enough? From the first day we met, we've never spent one day without speaking to each other."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Does-Tom-Brady-Want-His-John-Edward-Thomas-Moynahan-To-Play-Football.jpg><p>However, toward the end of the relationship, she gave an interview with Elle in 2022 that suggested she wanted to spend more time with Brady. "This is a very violent sport, and I have my children, and I would like him to be more present," Bündchen said at the time. "I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-tom-brady-39-s-approach-to-relationships-after-his-divorce>What Is Tom Brady's Approach To Relationships After His Divorce?</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">latest woman to be in Tom Brady's life is reported to be Veronika Rajek</a>, The Sports Rush reports. The rumors are believed to have been started after she posted a photo of herself wearing a Tampa Bay Buccaneers number 12 jersey (Brady was a quarterback for the team for his last three seasons).</p><p>But it was the caption that accompanied the post that really got people talking as she wrote: "I saw the LEGEND, and if somebody asks me again if I love Brady, yes I love him, and show me somebody who doesn't. Even his haters love him because they know he is the (goat)." Really, there is nothing else to go on other than the fact that she is a fan, and so are millions of others. So we cannot confirm that this is a coupling.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Tom Brady Finally Got Real About His Future And Why He Retired For 40 Days</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, in March 2023, a source told Page Six that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brady "is dating around</a>." Adding, "He's shopping. He is out and about."

We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together," he shared on an Instagram story (via StyleCaster).</p><p>"We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way.

Doing so is, of course painful, and difficult, like it is for so many people who go through the same thing everyday around the world. However, we wish only the best for each other as we pursue whatever new chapters in our lives that are yet to be written. And we kindly ask for privacy and respect as we navigate in what comes in the days and weeks ahead.
