In reality, however, <strong>Brady seemingly was completely unaware that Moynahan was carrying his child</strong> when they split.</p><p>To Glaser's credit, she played up the fact that Brady didn't know Moynahan was pregnant to make fun of the football great even more.</p><p>"To be fair, he didn't know.

As Glaser joked, Brady's extreme diet resulted in him losing the family he had with Gisele Bündchen.</p><p>After that joke, the roast's producers cut to a wide shot that included Brady. As a result, viewers got to see that <strong>Brady looked upset</strong> as he spoke to the person seated beside him seemingly about Glaser's jokes.</p><p>Of course, there is no way to know for sure that Brady was upset at that moment.

It seems like that loyalty survived Brady going on to play for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and then retiring.</p><p>Given Brady and Kraft's bond, the former football star should have expected there to be jokes about Kraft during his roast. Still, for many viewers, <strong>it seemed like Brady was mad that Ross joked about Kraft</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-cast-of-whose-line-is-it-anyway-roasted-drew-carey-in-these-edgy-moments-whose-line-is-it-anyway-_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Cast Of Whose Line Is It Anyway Roasted Drew Carey In These Edgy Moments</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The cast of Whose Line Is It Anyway seems to delight in mocking the show's host Drew Carey.</span><p>In 2019, Kraft was charged with two counts of soliciting following an investigation into Florida massage parlors. Ultimately, Kraft was cleared of all charges but the situation was such a big controversy that football fans certainly haven't forgotten.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Tom Brady's roast was streamed live on Netflix in 2024, the service held a similar event. In 2021, Netflix users got the chance to watch the roast of The Jonas Brothers.</p><p>As a result of how memorable this incident was, Jeff Ross made a joke about it. While describing a theoretical conversation between Brady and Kraft, Ross pretended to be the football star asking the Patriots' owner if he wanted a massage.</p><p>Several seconds after Ross' joke got a big laugh, the comedian was milking the response. At that moment, it seemed like Brady believed Ross was going to continue talking about Kraft's massage controversy. As a CBS Sports article about the roast describes, Brady got out of his chair, walked over to Ross who was still at the microphone, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>told the comedian, "Don't say that s**t again."</strong></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jeff-ross-and-kevin-hart-at-the-netflix-roast-of-tom-brady.jpg><p>After the roast, Jeff Ross made an appearance on The Rich Eisen Show. Unsurprisingly, Eisen asked Ross if Brady really was mad at his joke about Kraft. In response, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross stated that Brady wasn't actually mad</a></strong> and claimed the football legend was just playing along.</p><p>"Come on. Come on. No way. No way. He was having fun. He was having fun, you know? It's like, that's his dad, you know? That's like, Robert Kraft is like a father figure to him, you know? He was just showing his love for Robert Kraft."</p><p>Ross also told Eisen that Robert Kraft loved the joke. "And Robert Kraft loved it. We had a great talk afterward, and he was so happy that I gave him a shout-out and a salute."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdl7%2BisNhmmauhlJyytXnMqLCnmZiWu26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mpZ6slqG2uXnRqJisrF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html&text=Tom%20Brady%20Was%20Noticeably%20Upset%20When%20His%20Bridget%20Moynahan%20Relationship%20Was%20Blasted%20At%20His%20Roast&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html&title=Tom%20Brady%20Was%20Noticeably%20Upset%20When%20His%20Bridget%20Moynahan%20Relationship%20Was%20Blasted%20At%20His%20Roast" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html&title=Tom%20Brady%20Was%20Noticeably%20Upset%20When%20His%20Bridget%20Moynahan%20Relationship%20Was%20Blasted%20At%20His%20Roast" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html&title=Tom%20Brady%20Was%20Noticeably%20Upset%20When%20His%20Bridget%20Moynahan%20Relationship%20Was%20Blasted%20At%20His%20Roast" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html&description=Tom%20Brady%20Was%20Noticeably%20Upset%20When%20His%20Bridget%20Moynahan%20Relationship%20Was%20Blasted%20At%20His%20Roast" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-shay-carl-his-wiki-cheating-drama-net-worth-family-kids-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to Shay Carl?
