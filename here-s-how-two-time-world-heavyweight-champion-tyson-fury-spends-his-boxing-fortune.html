In this piece, we'll be taking you through just some of the things the popular fighter spends his hard-earned cash on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Tyson 'The Gypsy King' Fury Became A Boxing Champion</a></span></p><h2 id=amazing-holidays>Amazing Holidays</h2><p>Like most incredibly rich individuals, Tyson Fury enjoys using his money to take lavish vacations when the opportunity arises - and he's been on some fantastic ones in recent years.</p><p>For example, on a 2022 <a href=#>jaunt to France</a>, Fury and his wife Paris spent some time on an £18,000-a-night superyacht on the French Riviera, before spending the second half of their break&nbsp;in the luxury five-star Hotel Boscolo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-top-security-dog>A Top Security Dog</h2><p>Tyson Fury is a loving family man - he has a wife and six children - and he wants to protect them at all costs. For that reason, he recently purchased a security dog to guard his family home for a whopping £20,000.</p><p>The heavyweight champion used London-based Elite Protection Dogs to purchase the new&nbsp;Rottweiler, which he's named "Cash". The company also offers German Shepherds,&nbsp;Dobermanns and Cane Corsos - and it has an elite customer base that also includes former soccer star, Ashley Cole.</p><h2 id=an-antique-recovery-truck>An Antique Recovery Truck</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ever the quirky individual, there was always going to be a bizarrely eccentric purchase on this list of Fury's spending habits - and, sure enough, it comes in the form of an antique&nbsp;recovery truck.</p><p>The truck in question is a 1973&nbsp;Bedford TK - and Fury unveiled his new prized possession when he uploaded a video of his wife sitting in the vehicle's driver seat to Instagram.</p><h2 id=amazing-cars>Amazing Cars</h2><p>In addition to his quirky recovery truck, Fury has a more typical collection of vehicles in the form of an impressive fleet of cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, he purchased a pair&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=#>Rolls-Royce Phantom Series II cars</a> priced at a staggering £384,000 each. Other cars in his collection include a £140,000 Porsche Taycan&nbsp;and a more modest&nbsp;£20,000 Vauxhall Passat, which he uses to taxi his family around.&nbsp;Over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's also bought&nbsp;a stunning Ferrari GTC4Lusso</a> worth around £250,000,&nbsp;a&nbsp;£65,000 Range Rover Sport SVR, a&nbsp;£150,000 Mercedes G Wagon and a 1993 Mini Cooper that would've cost no more than £10,000.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Things Fans Should Know About The Gypsy King Tyson Fury</a></span></p><h2 id=seaside-homes>Seaside Homes</h2><p>When it comes to his homelife, Fury is very much a lover of Britain - and he doesn't stray too far when it comes to buying houses to live in. He bought a £500,000 home for his family that overlooks Morecambe Bay in the northwest of England - quite near to where he was born in Manchester - but having people constantly knocking on their door has prompted them to move. They haven't moved far, though, as they purchased a £1.7 million home - also in Morecambe - in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Fury does also own&nbsp;a £6 million mansion in Marbella and a pricey Las Vegas pad that has not had its value openly disclosed - but he and his family tend to use those properties more like holiday homes.</p><h2 id=a-1200-coffee-grinder>A £1200 Coffee Grinder</h2><p>£1,200 (around $1,500) doesn't necessarily sound like a lot of money - even to people who aren't as rich as Tyson Fury - but&nbsp;to splash that much cash on a coffee grinder, you really do have to be an affluent individual.</p><p>That's exactly what Fury did in the build-up to the final fight of his epic trilogy&nbsp;against Deontay Wilder. The grinder in question helped to fuel&nbsp;Fury and his team <a href=#>with delicious coffee</a> during his grueling training camp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=expensive-watches>Expensive Watches</h2><p>Tyson Fury loves a nice bit of bling - and nothing says "bling" more than a hugely expensive watch. Fury has a number of them.&nbsp;Most notably, he was seen wearing a £60,000 gold diamond-encrusted Rolex at Wembley Stadium in the build-up to his 2022 fight with Dillian Whyte.</p><p>However, it's far from the only lavish watch in his collection. Another example of his expensive wristwear includes a Rolex Sky-Dweller in 18k white gold - a watch that's said to have a market value of $35,000.</p><h2 id=an-energy-drink-business>An Energy Drink Business</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter who you are or how much money you have, it's always wise to have other irons in the fire. In Fury's case, he's invested some of his earnings into <a href=#>his own energy drink brand</a> - which will, hopefully, provide an ongoing source of income for him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once his sporting days are over</a>.</p><p>The drink in question is called "Furosity" and was launched in early 2022 in a deal with Iceland stores. Fury's intention&nbsp;is for the&nbsp;product&nbsp;to take over the energy drink market, trumping the likes of Red Bull and Monster in the process. Good luck to him!</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>8 Ways Anthony Joshua Spends His Boxing Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sportsman</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Star</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Express</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superwatchman</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnTsKZmrJmism7DzqujnWWYmq63xdaeoKCgpGKwqa3MqaCopl2pxrS7zWadrqqpYsCxsc2dqmagmah6o7vXoqWgZZakv7XBzZ5m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-tyson-fury-spends-his-boxing-fortune.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Two-Time%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion%20Tyson%20Fury%20Spends%20His%20Boxing%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-tyson-fury-spends-his-boxing-fortune.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-tyson-fury-spends-his-boxing-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Two-Time%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion%20Tyson%20Fury%20Spends%20His%20Boxing%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-tyson-fury-spends-his-boxing-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Two-Time%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion%20Tyson%20Fury%20Spends%20His%20Boxing%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-tyson-fury-spends-his-boxing-fortune.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Two-Time%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion%20Tyson%20Fury%20Spends%20His%20Boxing%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-two-time-world-heavyweight-champion-tyson-fury-spends-his-boxing-fortune.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Two-Time%20World%20Heavyweight%20Champion%20Tyson%20Fury%20Spends%20His%20Boxing%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jay-leno-news-us-weekly.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jay Leno News - Us Weekly">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./here-s-how-much-does-the-cast-of-summer-house-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Much Does The Cast Of 'Summer House' Make">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
