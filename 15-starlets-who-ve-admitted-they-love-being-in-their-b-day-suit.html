They just do so when you aren't looking!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next 15 women are not only all absolutely gorgeous, but they've all opened up in past interviews about their comfort with their own skin and you better believe we've tracked down those quotes.</p><p>Whether a former WWE superstar like Stacy Keibler or Trish Stratus (the latter of whom loves staying nude after a shower), current TV star like Sofia Vergara, or one&nbsp;of the biggest movie stars of all time like Halle Berry, there are plenty of reasons as to why these stars love staying naked on a regular basis.</p><p>We also have some of the more outrageous or raunchy stories out there; like the one of&nbsp;Alison Brie who went to a college where clothing was optional!</p><h2 id=15-halle-berry><strong>15. Halle Berry</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Halle Berry</a> has had plenty of roles where she teased you and still left some clothing wrapped on her body (or in the case of Catwoman, some latex!). Yet she's also had some incredibly huge movies like Monster's Ball which won her an Academy Award and saw her letting her "Berrys" hang out, not to mention she also didn't have a&nbsp;problem baring it all for the movie Swordfish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Berry sat down on the Ellen DeGeneres Show back in 2010, she was not shy to admit "I like being naked," while also mentioning that she will sometimes walk around the house without any clothes on.</p><h2 id=14-alicia-silverstone><strong>14. Alicia Silverstone</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Alicia Silverstone</a> had a chance to make a huge name for herself when she got cast as Batgirl in Batman & Robin, but sadly the film ended up being a monumental flop. To make matters worse, Silverstone was attacked in the media for having some scenes of the movie needing to be cut after the actress gained weight throughout filming.</p><p>Silverstone may have kept her superhero suit close to her skin in the movie, she is much less worried about letting her defenses down when hanging out at home. In a past interview, Silverstone said,</p><p>"I’ll go to any nude beach. I will take off my clothes in most circumstances. In fact, I even garden naked."</p><p>Call us crazy, but gardening naked doesn't sound like the right kind of dirty experience!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-rihanna><strong>13. Rihanna</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rihanna</a> has had plenty of opportunities as a model and musician to show the world her birthday suit. Plus, I mean, it's not like she isn't leaving much to the imagination in some of her music videos! For Rihanna while she initially felt a little uncomfortable in her own skin, she has quickly learned how to conquer that fear.</p><p>"The more I got naked the more comfortable I felt. I just had to face my fear. It was just knowing my body is the way it is no matter what that helped me. Knowing that it is what it is under clothes or outside of clothes,” said Rihanna in a past interview.</p><p>Sounds like she isn't planning to start covering up anytime soon!</p><h2 id=12-rooney-mara><strong>12. Rooney Mara</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rooney Mara</a> has a wide variety of experience as an actress, but you may know her best for her role as the lead in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The movie required Mara's character to let her clothing hit the floor, something that Mara said she was quite comfortable with,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm nude quite often, so it wasn't a big deal for me."</p><p>While that leads us to draw our own conclusions, it seems pretty clear that Mara is indicating that she has no problem lounging around the house without any clothes on.</p><p>When talking more about the role, Mara said, "Nudity is such a huge part of the character in the book, so I never thought twice about it. There was no time for hesitation. I didn’t have time to second-guess anything or be scared; I just showed up and was comfortable.”</p><h2 id=11-stacy-keibler><strong>11. Stacy Keibler</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a> is used to having all eyes on her, whether it was for her time in the wrestling ring or hitting up the dance floor on Dancing with the Stars. In both instances, Keibler has had plenty of moments where she has flashed plenty of skin, but as she has revealed in a past interview, that definitely doesn't both her,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think I'm a little bit freer than other people because, at a young age, I competed in dance competitions and we'd all be changing in the same room. In modelling, I'd get ready with males and females, dressing and undressing. So I lost my inhibition. My whole life, I've been around bodies, and I'm comfortable with mine."</p><p>While she has yet to appear in her birthday suit to the world, at least Keibler is confident in what she has!</p><h2 id=10-miley-cyrus><strong>10. Miley Cyrus</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> is definitely not shy to share her opinion as she called out other women for their fashion sense in a past interview saying,</p><p>"I just don't get what half the girls are wearing. Everyone to me seems like Vanna White. I'm trying to tell girls, like, 'F*** that. You don't have to wear makeup. You don't have to have long blonde hair and big t-tties. That's not what it's about. It's, like, personal style.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And for Cyrus, that "personal style" that she tends to use herself often ends up being her hanging out in her birthday suit! There is no shortage of naked photos of Cyrus out there on the internet. Cyrus opened up more about her love of being nude in another interview, saying that growing up, "We never were inside, and we never wore shoes. I think it's why I like wearing no clothes so much and I'm always naked."</p><p>We're glad she is confident in her body, but we bet her parents still wish she covered up on a more regular basis!</p><h2 id=9-ciara><strong>9. Ciara</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Ciara</a> and <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a> made big headlines when the two announced that they were going to wait until marriage to officially knock boots. When you consider the overtly sexual moves that Ciara rocks on a regular basis in her music videos, you can imagine the temptation was all the harder.</p><p>However long before Russell Wilson came around, Ciara was still making headlines for often wearing a minimal amount of clothing when out on the town. As a result, she was interviewed by Us Weekly on how&nbsp;comfortable she is in her own skin,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I feel the sexiest when I’m by myself, walking around nude. I have this new obsession with nudity, it’s really weird," said Ciara.</p><p>We're sure Wilson hopes this is a fad that she hasn't grown out of by 2017!</p><h2 id=8-eva-mendes><strong>8. Eva Mendes</strong></h2><p>There might not be a better-looking couple in Hollywood than <a href=#>Eva Mendes</a> and <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>. The two have been together since 2011 and have 2 children together. While you can understand children and Gosling's recent busy work schedule (as Mendes has taken a step back as of late) may dull the sparks at home, one thing that may keep that fire roaring is the fact that Mendes has admitted in a past interview that she has no problem not wearing clothes at home,</p><p>"I love being naked. I do everything in the nude, even the gardening! We’re Cuban, and it’s a hot island. Why not go nude?"</p><p>Mendes has also previously bared it all on the big screen for her&nbsp;roles in&nbsp;Training Day&nbsp;and&nbsp;We Own The Night.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-sofia-vergara><strong>7. Sofia Vergara</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a> will never take it all off when appearing on the television sitcom Modern Family, we are sure you still don't mind tuning in every week to find out what new captivating outfit they have elected to put her in. But one thing that the show is never going to be able to replicate, is what Vergara chooses to wear when she goes to sleep at home!</p><p>Vergara appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon back in 2015 when they played the game "catchphrase". Vergara was trying to get Fallon to guess the word "birthday suit" and attempted to give him the hint by asking him what she sleeps in!</p><p>There may not be a luckier guy in Hollywood than fellow actor Joe Manganiello who moved in with Vergara two days prior to the interview!</p><h2 id=6-cara-delevingne><strong>6. Cara Delevingne</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Cara Delevingne</a> had to know that when she decided she wanted to become a professional model, there were going to be some photoshoots where her clothes just happened to hit the floor. Thankfully for Delevingne, this has never been an issue for her. In fact, in a past interview, she admitted how she has always loved being naked,</p><p>"I used to love being naked. My parents would have to dress me because I'd just run around the supermarket and take off all my clothes. It was fun. Freedom. Liberation!"</p><p>We're sure that gave her parents quite the shock every time she elected to go for a naked sprint! Delevingne's most racy photoshoot may have come this past August when she posed in her birthday suit for Esquire.</p><h2 id=5-trish-stratus><strong>5. Trish Stratus</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Trish Stratus</a> is one of the most beautiful WWE Divas ever. All her time in the spotlight definitely made her incredibly confident in her body and in a past interview, she also opened up about how she loves to not wear clothes at home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Actually I walk around my house naked a lot. Especially when I come out of the shower I won't put on clothes for a long time. Also when I'm taking off my clothes to get into the shower or changing I'll stay naked for a while."</p><p>If that wasn't steamy enough, Stratus went on to say, "I like being naked and I like body, sometimes when I'm in the mood I'll just randomly take my clothes off and watch TV or do the laundry naked."</p><h2 id=4-jennifer-aniston><strong>4. Jennifer Aniston</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> has yet to bare it all on the big screen, but she does have the infamous scene from The Break-Up in which she elected to lounge around the house wearing nothing at all. Then there is also the scene from Friends in which she once again, elects to hang out at home and leave her clothes in the closet.</p><p>And back in 2013, after Aniston moved into a brand new mansion with <a href=#>Justin Theroux</a>, it was also reported by sources close to the couple that they were quite open about their love of walking around naked. In fact, the source even said that Aniston would even cook naked!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now while we cannot verify this and rumors are always going to be a part of Hollywood, we can hope for Aniston's sake that she didn't cook anything that splatters!</p><h2 id=3-alison-brie><strong>3. Alison Brie</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Alison Brie</a> may be wearing some adorable outfits on the show Community, but when she was going back to University for real you may have often found her wearing a heck of a lot less!</p><p>In a past interview, Brie admitted she went to the California College of the Arts; which has a "clothing optional" policy everywhere on campus&nbsp;but the cafeteria.</p><p>"From time to time I would put on a pair of tennis shoes—nothing else—and go for a little jog around the campus or swing from the trees to make my friends laugh. It was just funny; it didn’t seem weird to me. Even in college, I would go into the backyard, take off all my clothes and pretend to be a wood nymph behind the bushes for laughs,” said Brie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She did admit that she didn't go to class naked, but she did befriend the token nude guy that was at every party. You can only imagine that story from his perspective "Yeah, so when I used to party naked I was totally BFFs with Alison Brie!"</p><h2 id=2-demi-lovato><strong>2. Demi Lovato</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> has had some struggles with depression and some body image issues. But she has seemingly put those days behind her to the best of her ability and back in 2015, Lovato elected to strip off all of her clothes and makeup for a beautiful photoshoot for&nbsp;Vanity Fair.</p><p>Lovato talked about the photoshoot in a past interview,</p><p>"I would have never thought that I would have ever gotten to a place in my life where I would have felt comfortable doing that. I basically went from hating every single inch of my body to working on myself and trying to figure out ways to love myself, love the skin that I'm in."</p><p>Learning to love yourself can be one of the hardest things you do and&nbsp;we commend Lovato for the progress she has made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-heidi-klum><strong>1. Heidi Klum</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Heidi Klum</a> is one of the most successful models to ever enter the industry and you can imagine, as is the case with anyone who spends decades in the industry, Klum has spent plenty of time hanging out without clothes on.</p><p>For Klum, it has literally never been an issue, something she credits to her upbringing.</p><p>"My parents are still naked. I mean, it's not like we're hippies and we run around naked, but if they happened to be in their room changing or something or someone comes out of the shower, they're not, like, 'Oh my God. No. Close the door!,'" said Klum in a past interview.</p><p>Klum also admitted in the interview that she&nbsp;and <a href=#>Seal</a> (you know, back when they were still married!) would also often walk around the house naked.</p><p>sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>ellecanada.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2owaK%2By56rrGWnnby3sYyam6ahpKmypXnToZyyZZykw6Z5wZ6gp59dnrtuwMeeoKtlkmKxosWMrKyirF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-starlets-who-ve-admitted-they-love-being-in-their-b-day-suit.html&text=15%20Starlets%20Who%27ve%20Admitted%20They%20Love%20Being%20In%20Their%20B-Day%20Suit&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-starlets-who-ve-admitted-they-love-being-in-their-b-day-suit.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-starlets-who-ve-admitted-they-love-being-in-their-b-day-suit.html&title=15%20Starlets%20Who%27ve%20Admitted%20They%20Love%20Being%20In%20Their%20B-Day%20Suit" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-starlets-who-ve-admitted-they-love-being-in-their-b-day-suit.html&title=15%20Starlets%20Who%27ve%20Admitted%20They%20Love%20Being%20In%20Their%20B-Day%20Suit" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-starlets-who-ve-admitted-they-love-being-in-their-b-day-suit.html&title=15%20Starlets%20Who%27ve%20Admitted%20They%20Love%20Being%20In%20Their%20B-Day%20Suit" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-starlets-who-ve-admitted-they-love-being-in-their-b-day-suit.html&description=15%20Starlets%20Who%27ve%20Admitted%20They%20Love%20Being%20In%20Their%20B-Day%20Suit" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christina-mclarty-biography-age-birthday-height-weight-education-husband-wedding-sons-and-ne.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina McLarty Biography, Age, Birthday, Height, Weight, Education, Husband, Wedding, Sons and Ne">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tucker-max-net-worth-how-much-is-tucker-max-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tucker Max Net Worth  How Much is Tucker Max Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
