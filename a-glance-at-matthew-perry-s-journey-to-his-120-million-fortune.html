His quirky sense of humor kept fans laughing through every episode, and the journey that his character went on during the span of the show from 1994 - 2004 was nothing short of side-splitting, addictive entertainment. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry's contributions to the world of entertainment </a>have led him to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest levels of fame and fortune</a>, earning him an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">astounding $120 million net worth</a>. However, his personal life was far more painful and tumultuous than fans could have ever imagined. The ever-humorous Chandler on Friends was living a life of struggle and pain <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when the camera's&nbsp;stopped rolling</a>. He paid a high price for his rise to fame.</p><h2 id=a-very-canadian-upbringing>A Very Canadian Upbringing</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Langford Perry was born in Massachusetts on August 19th of 1969. His mother was a journalist and former secretary to the Prime Minister of Canada at the time, Pierre Trudeau. His father was an actor and model and was heavily immersed in the entertainment industry. His parents divorced shortly after Matthew was born, and his mother moved him to Canada, where he was raised for the majority of his life. Eventually, he found his way to the United States and pursued a career in acting, which proved to be one of the most monumental steps he took towards fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Minister Friend Issues: The Matthew Perry vs. Justin Trudeau Grade School Fight</a></span></p><h2 id=a-quick-rise-to-fame>A Quick Rise To Fame</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry was a natural talent, and his delivery of comedic antics and one-liners was undeniably entertaining. Many actors struggle through a series of failed pilots before landing a major gig in the industry, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry's rise to fame seemed to be far easier than that of his peers. </a>At the age of 18 he was cast in A Night In The Life Of Jimmy Reardon, which starred River Phoenix, and he moonlighted on the comedy stage in his spare time. Shortly thereafter he landed a roll in Second Chance, and really started to become recognized.</p><h2 id=the-close-call-that-would-have-changed-everything>The Close Call That Would Have Changed Everything</h2><p>Matthew Perry soon accepted a leading role on a show called LAX 2194. This was a futuristic television drama that was a few episodes into filming, and nearly cost him the biggest break of his career. After months of searching for the best actor to take on the role of Chandler Bing on Friends, Marta Kauffman, David Crane, and Kevin Bright were impressed with Perry's audition and knew they had to have him on their show. They took a chance on him, and eventually cast him on Friends, which was the biggest career move he ever made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=superstardom-on-friends>Superstardom On Friends</h2><p>Matthew Perry was a permanent fixture on Friends, and starred in all 263 episodes of the wildly successful series. F<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ans fell in love with his quirky sense of humor </a>and his inability to handle stress without quipping and chiming in with awkward humor. They reveled at the job his character had on the show - one that nobody could ever quite pinpoint or define. Then, fans took a journey alongside the actor as he transitioned from the awkward, funny version of Chandler Bing, to the slightly more confident Chandler that wound up in a serious relationship with Monica Gellar, played by Courteney Cox.</p><p>Friends was an instant hit with fans and David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Leblanc, Courteney Cox, and of course, Matthew Perry immediately rose to international fame before they even had a chance to realize<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the impact they were truly having on their fans.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He started off earning $22,500 per episode, and by the third season of filming, he was already pocketing $100,000 per episode. During the last few seasons, Perry was earning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an astounding $1 million per episode</a>, becoming one of the highest paid actors on television, and forever earning his iconic status as being part of this legendary production. Friends was a pop culture phenomenon, and Matthew Perry was a bonified star.</p><h2 id=serious-struggles-with-addiction>Serious Struggles With Addiction</h2><p>Unfortunately, Matthew Perry experienced the dark side of fame and continued to struggle for many years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His fans quickly became worried about his well being,</a> as he soon&nbsp;found himself drowning in addiction - something he would contend with for many years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview, Perry described the depths of his addiction by saying;&nbsp;“When [fame] happens, it’s kind of like Disneyland for a while. For me it lasted about eight months, this feeling of ‘I’ve made it, I’m thrilled, there’s no problem in the world.’ And then you realize that it doesn’t accomplish anything, it’s certainly not filling any holes in your life."</p><p>His time on set became a painful experience, as he struggled to cope with the demons he was facing, and still maintain the integrity of his privileged position on the show. He felt pressure, not wanting to let his cast mates down, but was well aware of the fact that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he was spiraling out of control.</a></p><p>Perry drew a parallel between his life, and that of his character Chandler Bing by stating;&nbsp;. “It’s no accident that Chandler is a guy who is trying to deter his own human emotional feelings with laughter. That’s what I did for years. I’ve tried to palm&nbsp;myself off as being a jokester, kind of like hanging out with me is kind of like a vacation. But that could only take me so far.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, his addiction was not the type that most assumed - it had nothing to do with fame and partying with hard drugs at all. In fact, Perry suffered an injury while jet skiing in 1997, and was prescribed Vicodin. He quickly became hooked on the drug, which led to alcoholism and his complete inability to arrive to work&nbsp;without being hungover. He admits it was extremely difficult to be 'the funny guy' while hung over so frequently, and his so his struggles began to magnify.</p><h2 id=his-struggles-to-overcome-addiction>His Struggles To Overcome Addiction</h2><p>Realizing that he needed help, Perry entered rehab for the very first time in 1997 and spent 28 days in a facility in Minnesota. The treatment didn't stick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In May 2000, Perry faced a huge health scare and was hospitalized for alcohol related pancreatitis. His appearance changed dramatically between seasons 6 and 7, with significant, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">visible weight loss and the obvious toll of his struggles </a>unfolding in front of the cameras.</p><p>During a 2002 interview Perry revealed; “I didn’t get sober because I felt like it. I got sober because I was worried I was going to die the next day.”</p><p>Perry would continue to struggle with addiction for several years. 2011 was a tough battle, and in 2013 he opened up the Perry House, designed to be a sober living facility for men, in Malibu, in an effort to help others overcome the very battles he was facing.</p><p>Years of abuse severely affected his health, and in 2018 Matthew Perry spent 3 months in the hospital&nbsp; recovering from surgery to repair a gastrointestinal perforation.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-today>Matthew Perry Today</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Today, Matthew Perry sits atop a massive fortune, earned by his incredible efforts and massive time investments in the world of entertainment. He starred in a number of movies on the big screen, and took on many acting roles, but will forever be cherished as Chandler Bing on one of the most impactful shows that continues to see success in syndication.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> He appeared on the Friends reunion,</a> and although he didn't quite seem to be himself, his loyal fans were delighted that he could join the rest of his cast mates in celebrating the milestone moment, and bask in the glory of his success.</p><p>It's hard to say whether or not fans will see Matthew Perry appear in any new projects, but for the moment, he has most certainly earned himself the right to take a few steps back and focus on his health and life away from the pressures of the media.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Ways Seth Rogen Earns And Spends His Multi-Million-Dollar Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Narcity</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Us Magazine</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMpKCnn12ks26%2FwKuamqudYq5us8uapZydXZbBbrnArauhnadivaa%2B0bKqZqKfqr%2Bvsdhmq6hlmJ7Abn2RaWSmoZyhtrC6jJ%2Bmq6ylo7Jw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-glance-at-matthew-perry-s-journey-to-his-120-million-fortune.html&text=A%20Glance%20At%20Matthew%20Perry%27s%20Journey%20To%20His%20%24120%20Million%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-glance-at-matthew-perry-s-journey-to-his-120-million-fortune.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-glance-at-matthew-perry-s-journey-to-his-120-million-fortune.html&title=A%20Glance%20At%20Matthew%20Perry%27s%20Journey%20To%20His%20%24120%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-glance-at-matthew-perry-s-journey-to-his-120-million-fortune.html&title=A%20Glance%20At%20Matthew%20Perry%27s%20Journey%20To%20His%20%24120%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-glance-at-matthew-perry-s-journey-to-his-120-million-fortune.html&title=A%20Glance%20At%20Matthew%20Perry%27s%20Journey%20To%20His%20%24120%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-glance-at-matthew-perry-s-journey-to-his-120-million-fortune.html&description=A%20Glance%20At%20Matthew%20Perry%27s%20Journey%20To%20His%20%24120%20Million%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christina-haack-s-most-candid-quotes-about-her-health-struggles.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Haack's Most Candid Quotes About Her Health Struggles">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-celebrities-who-went-above-and-beyond-for-a-fan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebrities Who Went Above And Beyond For A Fan">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
