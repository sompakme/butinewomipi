He’s just so happy, bright and funny. For a while I thought maybe I’d be a stay-at-home mom for a couple of years. But in Hollywood, it’s not as though it’s always a choice, you know? You feel very little control over the trajectory of your own career.”</p><p>The couple endured a huge scare with their son in August 2012, after <strong>Jack</strong> was born two months ahead of his due date. “I was having an uneventful, happy pregnancy, and so it was really a huge surprise that my water broke in the middle of the night,” she recalled. “I wish we didn’t have this biological clock. I’m thinking we have to start talking about it, looking at all kinds of options. I’m so lucky that I have a partner in Chris who’s in the same industry and really understands what’s required of me in terms of time commitment. But I was like, ‘Oh man, this s–t is f—ing hard.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/a250952a23296ab9cf956d9b536e33b45ed74492.jpg><p>Still, the Mom actress and Pratt really want to expand their family of three. “Very much so,” Faris said. “But it will definitely be a whole new complication because now I’m, like, a high-risk pregnancy, so it requires some different monitoring. My doctor’s like, ‘I don’t think you’ll have to be on bed rest the whole time.’ And I’m like, ‘I’m on a show.'”</p><p>Faris also shared with Health that she’s currently shaping up — thanks to the help of her husband. “He makes me feel really beautiful even when I’m feeling disgusting,” Faris gushed of the Guardians of the Galaxy hunk. “I’ll be in boxer shorts and a grubby T-shirt with greasy hair, and he’ll still be like, ‘Whoa, honey. Whoaaa.'”</p><p>It also helps that the Jurassic Park actor, 35, has been vigilant about maintaining his buff body. “Things are working in my favor right now,” Faris noted. “My job is so physical. I just don’t have time to sit down. I’ll get, like, a 15-minute break to eat a little bit, and then they’re like, ‘C’mon, we have to go!’ The other thing is that Chris is on a diet, which is helping me.'”</p><p>Working out with her husband, however, is not her forte. “When I work out with Chris at home, we go through a little routine,” she explained. “He has me do lunges and stuff, and the lunges get hard after a while. It’s really frustrating when someone you love is telling you how to improve your form!” And despite her personal vendetta against workouts, Faris says nothing in the world makes her happier than spending time with her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/anna-faris-inline-2.jpg><p>“Chris and I took Jack to the train museum. There were paparazzi, but we were just like, ‘It’s an odd thing that’s happening, but let’s not stress or stress Jack out,'” she explained. “At one point, Chris turned to me and said, ‘I don’t think I’ve ever been happier in my whole life.’ And I felt the same way.”</p><p>Unlike some of her Hollywood peers, Faris said she has an alternate perspective about paparazzi. “Most of them are pretty nice guys, just trying to make a living, and a lot of them are apologetic,” she said. “I think some celebrities are so mean to them and resent them so much. I mostly feel scared just going out without makeup on. But at the same time, I don’t want it to force a lifestyle change.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Faris joked that some people she works with want her to dress better. “They’re like, ‘Can you please not wear <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a> everywhere you go?'” she said with a laugh. “The scary part is that vulnerability of like, ‘Oh man, I’m gonna be in <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Stars Without Makeup’</a> again!'”</p><p>Even with her pretty face and great physique, Faris humbly noted that her beauty was “all surface” to Health. “I make sure my roots are good — although right now they’re not,” she shared. “I would love to be in a place where somebody comes to my house and just, like, spray-tans me and does my roots. But I just don’t have the patience for it. I don’t want to spend my free time doing that stuff. Even with massage these days, I’m like, ‘Ugh.’ I like to unwind with some wine and movies, and spend time with Chris and Jack.”</p><p>The new issue Health hits stands on Friday, Mar. 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaapp6Weqet0aKqZqegmru0edSpZJqan6rBbrTIoJ9mqpmouG680Z6ep5memMZursCbsGaikZi4bn6PamxqamNk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanna-faris-opens-up-about-high-risk-pregnancy-baby-jack.html&text=Anna%20Faris%20Opens%20Up%20About%20High-Risk%20Pregnancy%2c%20Baby%20Jack&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanna-faris-opens-up-about-high-risk-pregnancy-baby-jack.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanna-faris-opens-up-about-high-risk-pregnancy-baby-jack.html&title=Anna%20Faris%20Opens%20Up%20About%20High-Risk%20Pregnancy%2c%20Baby%20Jack" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanna-faris-opens-up-about-high-risk-pregnancy-baby-jack.html&title=Anna%20Faris%20Opens%20Up%20About%20High-Risk%20Pregnancy%2c%20Baby%20Jack" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanna-faris-opens-up-about-high-risk-pregnancy-baby-jack.html&title=Anna%20Faris%20Opens%20Up%20About%20High-Risk%20Pregnancy%2c%20Baby%20Jack" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanna-faris-opens-up-about-high-risk-pregnancy-baby-jack.html&description=Anna%20Faris%20Opens%20Up%20About%20High-Risk%20Pregnancy%2c%20Baby%20Jack" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./billie-eilish-addresses-rumors-of-a-rivalry-with-olivia-rodrigo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Billie Eilish Addresses Rumors Of A Rivalry With Olivia Rodrigo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./why-fans-are-concerned-about-mary-fitzgerald-s-mental-health-in-selling-sunset-season-6.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Fans Are Concerned About Mary Fitzgerald's Mental Health In Selling Sunset Season 6">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
