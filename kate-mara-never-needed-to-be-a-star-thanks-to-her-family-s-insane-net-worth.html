Take Kate Mara. She's done well for herself in acting, no doubt, but a closer look at her personal life reveals an astonishing amount of wealth, connections, and opportunities that are only available to a handful of people on the planet.

Mara has established herself as a force to be reckoned with in the world of acting.</p><p>Mara's breakthrough came in 2003 when she starred in the critically acclaimed drama series Everwood, where she played the complex and troubled character of Kate Warner.</p><p>Kate Mara's filmography boasts an impressive array of roles. In 2005, she starred alongside Heath Ledger in the Academy Award-winning film Brokeback Mountain.</p><p>Mara's career continued to soar with memorable performances in films such as Shooter with Mark Wahlberg, Transsiberian in 2008, and 127 Hours two years later. In 2015, she starred in the superhero film Fantastic Four.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear that the actress has done well for herself in Hollywood, and that's thanks to a lot of hard work and dedication to her craft. While this is true, it certainly helps that Mara comes from an exceptionally wealthy family, which has afforded here the luxury of pursuing a career in the arts.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Alec Baldwin Speaks Defunding Police, Demonizing Wealth, Slams QAnon And Ties To Jeffrey Epstein</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-mara-never-needed-acting-thanks-to-her-family>Kate Mara Never Needed Acting Thanks To Her Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49356201.jpg><p>For the unfamiliar, both Kate and her sister, Rooney, come from NFL Royalty: the Mara family. The Mara family owns the New York Giants.</p><p>"The Mara family fortune all began with Tim Mara. He was born into an impoverished Irish family living in New York City's Lower East Side in 1887. He later dropped out of school, at 13, to go to work full time. He eventually found work as a bookie, and became quite successful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In 1925, the President of the NFL, Joseph Carr, found himself unable to find someone to helm a New York NFL team. College football was hugely popular, but audiences seemed relatively uninterested in professional football. Through a mutual friend, Carr was introduced to Tim Mara. After some discussion, Mara purchased New York's NFL franchise for $500. (Approximately $12,500 in today's money.)," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports.</p><p>Yeah, the Mara clan is loaded, and to this day, they still own half the team. The other half belongs to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Tisch family</a>. Remember that acting school that Mara went to? Yeah, that's the same Tisch family.</p><p>Starting to make sense now?</p><p>The Mara's have an exorbitant amount of wealth and connections, but unbelievably, they aren't even the only wealth family in the picture here.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Scooter Braun's Wealth Set To Skyrocket As He Enters Huge Cannabis Deal With Billionaire</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-mara-is-also-from-the-rooney-family>Kate Mara Is Also From The Rooney Family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49356201-2.jpg><p>Not only are Kate and her sister both from the Mara family, but they are also from the Rooney family.</p><p>Who are the Rooneys?</p><p>"The Rooney family fortune began with Arthur Joseph "Art" Rooney, Sr., who was born in 1901 in the Pittsburgh area. He excelled in sports throughout his school years and went on to win the AAU welterweight belt in 1918. He played Minor League Baseball and led the league in games, runs, and steals in 1925. He also played halfback for a couple of semi-pro football teams. In 1933, he paid $2,500 to form an NFL team in Pittsburgh. Originally called the Pittsburgh Pirates, just like the baseball team, the football franchise went through many ups and downs. They were renamed the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1941, and Rooney became President, as well as owner, at the end of World War II," Celebrity Net Worth writes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, Kate literally comes from two families that own NFL teams, and that have extreme amounts of wealth between them.</p><p>Just like the Mara's, the Rooney's are extremely connected.</p><p>For Kate Mara, the talent and experience is there, but having the wealth and connections that she has proved to be a colossal boost to her career. She was afforded the luxury of trying her hand over and over again at acting, all while getting an acting education at a prestigious university that bears the name of the family that co-owns a football team with her own.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Todd And Julie Chrisley Get Away With Fraud While Flaunting Their Wealth On Reality TV?</a></span></p><p>Had Kate Mara never made it as an actress, she would have been just fine.
