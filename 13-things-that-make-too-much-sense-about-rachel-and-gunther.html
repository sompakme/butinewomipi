Stars Hollow would be an incredible place to live (especially thanks to the food at Luke's Diner). Joey and Dawson are soulmates even if some fans want her to be with Pacey. And Ross and Rachel are an iconic couple on the sitcom&nbsp;Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it's impossible to think of this TV show not featuring this classic relationship, there is another character who has a crush on Rachel, and it's none other than Gunther.&nbsp;He manages the coffee shop, Central Perk, that is one of the series' main locations. Sure, Ross and Rachel are always going to be one of the major pairings here, but what if Rachel had dated someone else... and what if it had actually been Gunther?</p><p>Keep reading to find out why a Rachel/Gunther love story would be pretty logical.</p><h2 id=rachel-and-gunther-were-co-workers-for-a-long-time-and-many-romances-begin-that-way><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Rachel And Gunther&nbsp;Were&nbsp;Co-Workers For A Long Time, And Many Romances Begin That Way</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gunther-On-Friends.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One reason why Rachel and Gunther make too much sense as a couple, is that they have been co-workers for a long time. It's definitely true that many relationships begin that way, as people get a chance to get to know each other and spend a lot of time together. It seems totally logical that they would have started to date.</p><h2 id=they-were-actually-going-to-be-roomies-once-but-the-story-was-scrapped><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Were Actually Going To Be Roomies Once, But The Story Was Scrapped</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rachel-On-Friends.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro.co.uk</a>, Rachel and Gunther were going to be roommates on&nbsp;Friends, but the story was scrapped.</p><p>This seems like it would have been cool to see... and more than that, it could have been the catalyst for romance.

For that reason, it seems like Gunther has been more devoted to Rachel than Ross, and it would have been interesting to see these two characters explore a relationship. When we think about it, it makes sense, right?</p><h2 id=they-are-both-meant-for-bigger-things-than-central-perk><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They&nbsp;Are&nbsp;Both Meant For Bigger Things Than Central Perk</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gunther-Rachel-Friends.jpg><p>Central Perk is a great place to hang out (and the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;gang definitely spends hours there).
