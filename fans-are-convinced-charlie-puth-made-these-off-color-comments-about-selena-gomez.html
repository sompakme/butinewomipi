As a result, he rose to fame gradually throughout the years, amassing millions of fans worldwide. From his early days on YouTube to his chart-topping hits like "Attention" and "We Don't Talk Anymore," Charlie Puth has become a force to be reckoned with in the music industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it's not just his music that's making headlines these days. Rumors have been swirling that Charlie Puth may have made some off-color comments about none other than <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>. The two celebrities have been linked in the past, with rumors of a romantic relationship circulating for years.</p><p>Fans are convinced that Charlie Puth's comments about the meaning of one of his songs may have been aimed at Selena Gomez.</p><h2 id=charlie-puth-and-selena-gomez-are-rumored-to-have-had-a-fling-in-2016>Charlie Puth And Selena Gomez Are Rumored To Have Had A Fling In 2016</h2><p>When it comes to celebrity relationships, few are as intriguing as the rumored romance between Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez. However, it isn't a secret that her most publicized love story was the one with Justin Bieber which spanned over several years.</p><p>Still, at some point in 2016 during Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's relationship, they took a break. That was when Charlie Puth was linked to Selena Gomez, and they collaborated on the hit song "We Don't Talk Anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/untitled-design-76.jpg><p>Fans couldn't help but notice the chemistry between the two musicians, and rumors of a fling began to circulate. While neither Charlie Puth nor Selena Gomez ever confirmed the relationship directly, there were plenty of clues to suggest that something was going on.</p><p>They were spotted together on numerous occasions. Still, as it happens in Hollywood, there is always some drama involved. They went on their separate ways, and Selena Gomez started dating Justin Bieber again.</p><p>During an interview for Billboard, Charlie Puth somehow subtly confirmed that something was going on between him and Selena Gomez, mentioning that he couldn't get past the fact that someone else was always in Selena Gomez's mind, adding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that it really "messed him up."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Forgot All About Charlie Puth's Long-Ago YouTube Debut</a></span></p><p>When it comes to Selena Gomez's feelings for Charlie Puth, it's not really clear since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she hasn't made anything public about their relationship</a>. While Selena Gomez may have had a tumultuous and very public love story with Justin Bieber, it might be possible that she wanted to keep the rumored relationship with Charlie Puth private from the public's eye.</p><p>Despite never publicly confirming their relationship, Charlie Puth's off-color comments about Selena Gomez have reignited speculation about their past romance, and some of her millions of fans aren't really happy about his description of some incidents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-puth-was-criticized-for-his-remarks-on-selena-gomez>Charlie Puth Was Criticized For His Remarks On Selena Gomez</h2><p>Charlie Puth is once again making headlines, and not for the reasons he might have hoped. The singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">came under fire for some off-color comments</a> he made during an interview about his hit song "Attention." During the interview for Genius, Charlie Puth discussed being in a hotel room in the Philippines with a girl and being confused, at the same time, about her intentions.</p><p>Allegedly, the girl he was with started complaining about being "mistreated" by her ex-boyfriend. Charlie apparently misunderstood the situation as an invitation for him to be the guy "who fixes it," especially because they were spending a lot of time together.</p><p>So, when nothing really happened between them that night, he seemed annoyed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/charlie-puth-at-the-2022-new-york-jingle-ball.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It’s very gross to expect someone to sleep with you because you’re nice to them. No one owes you anything. It just sounded like the person needed a supportive friend," wrote one fan, pointing out that he surely misunderstood the entire situation.</p><p>Considering the immense popularity of Selena Gomez worldwide, fans put the pieces together and claimed that "that girl" was actually the former Disney star.</p><p>When he revealed during the same interview that they had quite a few sleepovers and reportedly didn't get what he "wanted out of her," fans went wild criticizing his remarks and calling them "unnecessary."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How The Charlie Puth Is Gay Rumor Actually Started</a></span></p><p>Others even went further to claim that "I know a lot of us have met a guy or two like this before," disagreeing totally with Charlie Puth's attitude about the rumored fling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he may have had a past with the singer, many feel that he should have kept their relationship private and not used it for publicity.

As a result of this constant attention, <a href=#>Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber accused each other of different wrongdoings in their relationship</a> once they had broken up definitely.</p><p>Time has passed since then, but it seems that Charlie Puth brought back all the memories with his off-color comments about that night in the hotel room.
