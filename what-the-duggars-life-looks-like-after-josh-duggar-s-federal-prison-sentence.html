The reality show ran for an impressive 10 seasons and was formerly known as 17 Kids and Counting and 18 Kids and Counting. The name changes were due to the births of two children during the show. TLC’s show followed the Duggar family, a devout Baptist family in Arkansas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the show was canceled in 2015, the world was shocked to learn it was due to Josh Duggar being involved in a police investigation for sexually assaulting five young girls. Now, Duggar is facing over 12 years in federal prison for child pornography. The Duggar family is divided in the matter. Here’s how the Duggar family feels about Josh Duggar’s sentence and what their lives are like now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Will Josh Duggar Get Out Of Prison Based On His Recent Appeal?</a></span></p><h2 id=who-are-the-duggars><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Are The Duggars?</span></h2><p>The Duggar family were the focus of TLC’s hit television show 19 Kids and Counting. They reside in Tontitown, Arkansas. The parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, have given birth to 19 children, including Josh, Jana, Jill, and Joseph. Many of the Duggar children now also have families of their own, so family reunions must be quite a party.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A key focus of the Duggars and their reality show was their religious beliefs. Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have spoken out about how they refuse to use any kind of birth control, allowing God to determine how large their family gets.</p><h2 id=why-was-19-kids-and-counting-cancelled><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Was 19 Kids And Counting Cancelled?</span></h2><p>After 10 seasons on TLC, 19 Kids and Counting was cancelled in 2015. The end of the reality show was due to the release of Josh Duggar’s police investigation from before the show initially aired. Though he had never been convicted, he was accused of molesting five young girls, including four of his sisters, in 2002 and 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In Touch Magazine broke the news to the world</a>. They claimed Josh’s father had taken him to the police after catching him leave his sister’s bedroom. Weird circumstances prevented Josh from being prosecuted, and now the statute of limitations have passed.</p><h2 id=why-is-josh-duggar-going-to-prison><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Is Josh Duggar Going To Prison?</span></h2><p>Josh Duggar’s criminal activity did not end after previous police investigation. In 2021, Josh was arrested for child pornography, and <a href=#>the details of his criminal behavior have disgusted fans</a>. The arrest was due to a raid on his work computer. His arrest also triggered the cancellation of Counting On, a spinoff of the Duggar family’s 19 Kids and Counting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On May 25, 2022, Duggar was sentenced to 151 months in federal prison. That is roughly 12.5 years in prison for his crimes. The sentencing is in spite of many letters sent to the judge from Duggar’s wife and mother, who pleaded for a lighter sentence by supporting his character.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Josh Duggar’s Wife Blasted As She ‘Stands By Him’ Despite Indecent Image Charge</a></span></p><h2 id=anna-duggar-supports-husband-josh-duggar><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Anna Duggar Supports Husband Josh Duggar</span></h2><p>Despite his arrest, Josh Duggar’s wife continues to stand by him. Anna Duggar has continued to support her husband throughout his heinous scandals and has no plans to divorce him. She even sent a letter to Duggar’s judge in the hopes of either dismissing the case or getting him a lighter sentence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the legal affair, <a href=#>Anna Duggar gave birth to their 7th child</a>. Fans are outraged with Anna for not putting her children’s safety first. Her reasoning for staying with Duggar stems from her religious upbringing. Anna now faces raising her 7 children by herself.</p><h2 id=michelle-duggar-stands-by-her-son><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Michelle Duggar Stands By Her Son</span></h2><p>Michelle Duggar, despite knowing her son has molested her other children and has been convicted for child pornography, supports Josh. She also sent a letter to the judge to speak on her son’s character.</p><p>She hoped her son would be “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunited with his wife and family in a timely manner</a>.” She also claimed “Joshua has a tender heart, and he is compassionate toward others.” She signed the letter by dotting the “i” in Michelle. Family members of Michelle Duggar are not pleased with her dismissal of her son’s criminal behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-david-duggar-no-longer-respects-his-older-brother><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>John David Duggar No Longer Respects His Older Brother</span></h2><p>While other family members have stood by Josh Duggar, including some of his sisters whom he molested as a child, John David Duggar is not among them. During an episode of Counting On, <a href=#>John discussed his relationship with his older brother</a>.</p><p>Due to Josh’s criminal behavior and the fact that he had an affair, John no longer feels his brother upholds family or religious values. While John used to say “I always wanted to be like him,” John no longer feels that way. “One of the toughest things I had to tell my older brother was: ‘I don’t want to be like you anymore.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Other Members Of The Duggar Family Have Been Up To Since Josh’s Arrest</a></span></p><h2 id=jana-duggar-settles-child-endangerment-citation><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jana Duggar Settles Child Endangerment Citation</span></h2><p>John Duggar is not the only sibling removing themselves from the family drama. Jana Duggar received a child endangerment citation around the time her brother was charged with child pornography. The case, which was a result of a child Duggar was babysitting accidently wandering outside, was settled outside of court.</p><p>Jana Duggar is certainly tired of the scandals and drama, and she is now focused on her interior design business. She is in the beginning stages of starting Arbor Acres, which will sell items for the home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amy-duggar-king-calls-out-duggar-family><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Amy Duggar King Calls Out Duggar Family</span></h2><p>Amy Duggar is Josh Duggar’s cousin. She has been very public about her disgust with the rest of her family. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I don’t think anyone would make the mistake of assuming I support my cousin</a>,” Amy told People. She was sickened by her family’s response to the trial and “furious at the family members that looked the other way and still today, refuse to hold him accountable.”</p><p>Amy also called out Josh’s wife Anna, urging her to divorce the criminal. Amy also wishes there was a larger sentence and better justice was given to the children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYydrKCfkafAbrjIn5xmpJ%2BkuLR5y6KinmWRm8GmvoyjpqygXZnCqLPAq6pmnpWZsrOty2anq6GjpLtuv8Snq56mk5p8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-the-duggars-life-looks-like-after-josh-duggar-s-federal-prison-sentence.html&text=What%20The%20Duggars%20Life%20Looks%20Like%20After%20Josh%20Duggars%20Federal%20Prison%20Sentence&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-the-duggars-life-looks-like-after-josh-duggar-s-federal-prison-sentence.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-the-duggars-life-looks-like-after-josh-duggar-s-federal-prison-sentence.html&title=What%20The%20Duggars%20Life%20Looks%20Like%20After%20Josh%20Duggars%20Federal%20Prison%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-the-duggars-life-looks-like-after-josh-duggar-s-federal-prison-sentence.html&title=What%20The%20Duggars%20Life%20Looks%20Like%20After%20Josh%20Duggars%20Federal%20Prison%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-the-duggars-life-looks-like-after-josh-duggar-s-federal-prison-sentence.html&title=What%20The%20Duggars%20Life%20Looks%20Like%20After%20Josh%20Duggars%20Federal%20Prison%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-the-duggars-life-looks-like-after-josh-duggar-s-federal-prison-sentence.html&description=What%20The%20Duggars%20Life%20Looks%20Like%20After%20Josh%20Duggars%20Federal%20Prison%20Sentence" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-errol-spence-dating-errol-spence-girlfriend-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Errol Spence dating?
