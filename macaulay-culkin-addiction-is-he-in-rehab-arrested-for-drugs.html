Family crisis and a failing career got to him, and he spiraled into a drug abuse habit.</span></p><p><span>However, in 2020, Macaulay stated that his drug days were over. He insisted on not touching drugs anymore as he opened up about his plans to start a family with his girlfriend, Brenda Song, and their three cats.</span></p><p><span>In a candid interview with&nbsp;</span><span>Esquire</span><span>, the Actor admitted he ‘played with Fire’ using drugs but somehow passed his darkest days without checking into rehab.</span></p><p><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>Home Alone</span><span>&nbsp;star said drugs are like his old friends and added, “But sometimes you outgrow your friends.” He shared that he did not do drugs recreationally besides occasional muscle relaxers.</span></p><p><span>The 42-year-old did not have a great childhood. Macaulay said his Father was cruel and violent when he was a kid. He felt his dad was jealous of his career.</span></p><p><span>His parents separated when he was a teenager. He took his parents to court to prevent them from controlling his trust fund, reportedly worth $15 to 20 million. He has been estranged from his Father ever since.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=macaulay-culkin-was-arrested-for-drugs></span><span>Macaulay Culkin Was Arrested For Drugs</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Macaulay Culkin is not currently under arrest. He claims to be past his drug years. But in 2004, when Macaulay was 24, his mugshot made headlines worldwide.</span></p><p><span>After Police officers searched his car in Oklahoma City in September 2004, he was charged with possessing marijuana and two controlled substances, Alprazolam and Clonazepam, without a prescription.</span></p><p><span>He was briefly jailed and later released on $4,000 bail. After appearing in court for misdemeanor drug offenses, he initially pleaded not guilty but later reversed the plea to guilty.</span></p><p><span>Macaulay then received three one-year suspended prison sentences and $540 fees.</span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=learn-about-macaulay-culkin-family-and-love-life></span><span>Learn About Macaulay Culkin Family And Love Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><span>Macaulay Carson Culkin was born in New York City to his parents, Christopher Cornelius “Kit” Culkin and Patricia Brentrup. His Father was a stage Actor and worked as a church sacristan, while his mother worked as a telephone operator.</span></p><p><span>Patricia, a native of North Dakota, relocated with Cristopher to New York City. The couple was never married but gave birth to seven children.</span></p><p><span>Macaulay’s siblings include 47-year-old Shane, Dakota (1979–2008), 41-year-old Kieran, 39-year-old Quinn, 36-year-old Christian, and 34-year-old Rory.</span></p><p><span>His elder sister, Dakota, died after being hit by a car in 2008. He also had a half-sister from his dad’s side, Jennifer Adamson (1970 – 2000), who died of a drug overdose.</span></p><p><span>Macaulay married fellow Actress Rachel Miner in 1998 when they were both 18 but divorced after four years. Afterward, he started dating Actress Mila Kunis in 2002, which reportedly ended in 2010.</span></p><p><span>Later, he formed a relationship with his&nbsp;</span><span>Changeland</span><span>&nbsp;co-star Brenda Song and the couple had a son in April 2021, whom they named Dakota Song Culkin after Macaulay’s late sister.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Macaulay’s paternal aunt is American Actress Bonnie Bedelia. He is an American national of Irish, German, Norwegian, and other European descent.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: Does Luke Grimes Have Kids?
