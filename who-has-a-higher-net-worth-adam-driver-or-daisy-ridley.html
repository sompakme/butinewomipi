For example, when most people think about Star Wars, actors like Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and James Earl Jones are likely to come to mind very quickly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though virtually everyone who has been a Star Wars fan for decades will continue to associate the franchise with its original stars first and foremost, all things must change. After all, there are generations of people who grew up when the prequel trilogy was being released and a lot of younger fans love the sequel trilogy most of all. For those younger fans, they are likely to think of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver first when Star Wars gets brought up.</p><p>For all Star Wars fans, there are a lot of reasons to closely associate Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. For example, Rey and Kylo Ren were the sequel trilogy’s two main characters. On top of that, the link their characters shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">played a pivotal role</a> in storylines. With all of that in mind, it makes sense to compare the two actors to one another by asking whether Adam Driver has a higher net worth than Daisy Ridley or vice versa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Details About The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy We Actually Love</a></span></p><h2 id=dasiy-s-major-leap-forward>Dasiy’s Major Leap Forward</h2><p>When it was announced that Daisy Ridley was going to star in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, millions of people around the world reacted by asking, who? After all, before Ridley was cast as Rey, she had appeared in a single episode of a handful of TV shows, and a bunch of short films. Of course, it may be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hard to remember</a> this now but when Carrie Fisher first played Princess Leia, she wasn’t famous either.</p><p>Once Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released, Daisy Ridley quickly became so famous that it was hard for moviegoers to not know who she is. That was the case because Ridley’s character, Rey, was the single most talked-about character coming out of that movie since a lot of people loved her and some people certainly didn’t. From there, Ridley would go on to play the lead character in Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, all of the Star Wars movies Daisy Ridley starred in did massive business at the box office. On top of that, Ridley also landed memorable roles in films like Murder on the Orient Express, Ophelia, and Peter Rabbit. Given all of that, it makes sense that even though Ridley is still early in her career, she has already amassed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$9 million</a> fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Little-Known Facts About Daisy Ridley’s Life Before Star Wars</a></span></p><h2 id=adam-takes-the-spotlight>Adam Takes The Spotlight</h2><p>Unlike Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver was already building a solid reputation in Hollywood before he was cast as Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ Kylo Ren. Best known as one of the stars of the show Girls at that time, Driver had also appeared in several movies before he became a part of Star Wars history. Of course, despite everything that Driver had already accomplished, his career really took off once he began playing Kylo Ren.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of playing Kylo Ren in three Star Wars movies, Adam Driver has become one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood over the last several years. One of those rare actors who seems to be able to do everything in Hollywood, Driver has proven to be right at home in blockbuster films like the Star Wars franchise. Of course, Driver also seems to delight in being a part of smaller films like Logan Lucky, BlacKkKlansman, and Marriage Story among others. Since Driver is in such high demand, he has been able to demand several lucrative paydays which has resulted in him amassing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$16 million</a> fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Known Facts About Adam Driver's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><h2 id=how-things-might-change>How things Might Change</h2><p>At this point in time, there is no doubt that Adam Driver is a more accomplished actor than Daisy Ridley. However, we all know that things can change in Hollywood at a moment’s notice. With that in mind, there is every reason in the world to think that Ridley may be able to eclipse her former co-star in terms of wealth in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for Daisy Ridley, her most noteworthy 2021 project is the movie Chaos Walking and it seems very likely that the film is going to flop. After all, when it was released in South Korea it landed with a thud and it has been panned by a lot of critics. However, Ridley headlined three Star Wars movies that were huge hits so it seems likely that the studios will give her several more chances in the future. Assuming any of Ridley’s upcoming projects become a hit, Hollywood could easily come to believe in her more than Adam Driver and pay her a fortune to star in their films as a result.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Walking: The Chaotic Events Of Tom Holland And Daisey Ridley's Unreleasable' Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecBmn6KfmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptW6tw5qkZpyinsOmvoyoqWackZ7AunnRopulnalk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-has-a-higher-net-worth-adam-driver-or-daisy-ridley.html&text=Who%20Has%20A%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Adam%20Driver%20Or%20Daisy%20Ridley%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-has-a-higher-net-worth-adam-driver-or-daisy-ridley.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-has-a-higher-net-worth-adam-driver-or-daisy-ridley.html&title=Who%20Has%20A%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Adam%20Driver%20Or%20Daisy%20Ridley%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-has-a-higher-net-worth-adam-driver-or-daisy-ridley.html&title=Who%20Has%20A%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Adam%20Driver%20Or%20Daisy%20Ridley%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-has-a-higher-net-worth-adam-driver-or-daisy-ridley.html&title=Who%20Has%20A%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Adam%20Driver%20Or%20Daisy%20Ridley%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-has-a-higher-net-worth-adam-driver-or-daisy-ridley.html&description=Who%20Has%20A%20Higher%20Net%20Worth%3a%20Adam%20Driver%20Or%20Daisy%20Ridley%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-do-some-people-crave-peanut-butter-when-pregnant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Do Some People Crave Peanut Butter When Pregnant?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-christina-masterson-husband-name-details-on-her-relationship-with-youtuber-andrew-gray-expl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Christina Masterson Husband Name?
