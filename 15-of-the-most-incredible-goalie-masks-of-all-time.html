Plante was not wearing a mask, which was very common and normal back then. After being stitched up and refusing to play without a mask, Plante returned to the ice, wearing a face hugging mask. This would prove to be a very important moment in hockey history, even though&nbsp;at the time, Plante was actually laughed at for wearing the mask. Many questioned his dedication and his fearlessness. However, as time went on, the goalie mask became accepted and eventually mandatory. Two things goalies realized about the mask, first was the most obvious in that it protected their face and improved their play. Second and most important, they realized they could put some awesome, cool and badass designs on it. Here is a look at 15 of the most incredible hockey goalie masks of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-steve-valiquette---spider-man>15)&nbsp;Steve Valiquette - Spider-Man</h2><p>via:www.sportscardforum.com</p><p>Steve Valiquette is a crime fighter known as Spider-Man…er…was a goalie for the New York Rangers. His goalie mask is one of the most underrated masks, possibly because of his short career. Regardless, the mask is impressive and featured&nbsp;the web slinging Spider-Man.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-jonathan-quick---battle-armour>14)&nbsp;Jonathan Quick - Battle Armour</h2><p><a title="Jonathan Quick Net Worth" href=#>Jonathan Quick</a> plays for the Los Angeles Kings and with them, he has won two Stanley Cups, in 2012 and 2014. He is also a silver medal winner at the 2010 Winter Olympics. He has had several awesome, unique and very cool goalie masks. So many that he should have his own list. His masks range from patriotic to simple and intimidating.</p><p></p><h2 id=13-ed-belfour---the-eagle>13)&nbsp;Ed Belfour - The Eagle</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed Belfour is known for his skills, ability and the fact that he really, really likes eagles. He has played for several teams including, the Chicago Blackhawks, San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Florida Panthers. His goalie mask would feature an eagle on every team he played for. He once said, "I've always liked the eagle as a bird. It is a strong figure representing individuality, leadership, confidence and outstanding vision...." He was soon nicknamed "Eddie the Eagle". His other nickname is "Crazy Eddie", due to his reported off ice antics.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-ken-dryden---montreal-canadians>12)&nbsp;Ken Dryden - Montreal Canadians</h2><p>phgsports.com</p><p>It's simple, basic and crude, yet it's possibly one of the most horrifying hockey masks of all time. Imagine, skating down the ice with everything a player has left, only to look up and see the eyes of Ken Dryden peering back through that expressionless and terrifying mask. Despite being considered one of the all time great goaltenders, he actually had a short career, playing seven seasons. He won several Stanley Cups with the Montreal Canadians and in his first year, 1971, he won the Conn Smythe Trophy for Most Valuable Player.</p><p></p><h2 id=11-henrik-lundqvist---statue-of-liberty>11)&nbsp;Henrik Lundqvist&nbsp;- Statue Of Liberty</h2><p>tenderslounge.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a title="Henrik Lundqvist Net Worth" href=#>Henrik Lundqvist</a>&nbsp; is a Swedish hockey player who plays for the New York Rangers.

He first joined the team in 2000, and with the Ducks, won the Stanley Cup in 2007. He was traded to the Colorado Avalanche with rumours circulating that this might be his final year. He's had many memorable goalie masks, especially from his time with the Ducks. However, nothing can strike fear in the hearts of his enemies like a yeti does. His mask features a yeti, or one could say that he is the yeti and the mask brings that out of him. Either way, a yeti is both terrifying and very cool.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-gary-bromley---bones>9)&nbsp;Gary Bromley - Bones</h2><p>via:www.sikids.com</p><p>Gary Bromley played for both the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks.

However, he may be best known for his iconic stitch pattern goalie mask. He was one of the first goalies to put a design on his mask. Each stitch on the mask represents stitches he would have to get if he was not wearing the mask.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-peter-budaj---ned-flanders>3)&nbsp;Peter Budaj - Ned Flanders</h2><p><a title="Peter Budaj Net Worth" href=#>Peter Budaj</a> has played for the Colorado Avalanche and Montreal Canadians.
