They use this money to support political activities on their own.</p><p>The particular group in question is known as Make America Great Again, the same mantra that Trump used to drive his successful quest for the highest office in the land in 2016. The news was first made public by The New York Times, in a report that claimed that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">payments to Melania</a> had been made in December 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The NYT bombshell was published in July 2023, about one and a half years later.

It was not lost on the public as well as the press, with questions looming over the potential reasons for her no-show.</p><p>Melania not showing up for her husband’s court dates did not help whispers of a potential fallout between the former first couple.
