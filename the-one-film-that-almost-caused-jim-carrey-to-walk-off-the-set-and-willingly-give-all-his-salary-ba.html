Although he thrived in the role, the experience was a disaster behind the scenes. Carrey almost left the film, and wound up joining CIA training in order to cope with the stress of it all.</p><p>We're going to reveal what stressed Carrey out the most from the film, and how a certain co-worker behind the scenes had to check into therapy after their experience with the actor on-set.

With Jim Carrey in the lead as The Grinch, the project wasn't exactly his favorite, and that stemmed from the restraints of the make-up. Carrey felt as though he was suffocating most times.</p><p>“The first day was eight-and-a-half hours and I went back to my trailer and put my leg through the wall.”</p><p>“I couldn’t see. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t scratch myself. The physical restraints were unbelievable. It was just like having a refrigerator strapped to your back,” Carrey said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Truth About Jim Carrey's Rarely Talked-About Health Condition</a></span></p><p>In order to cope with the hardships attached to the role, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Carrey took on CIA training</a>.

Firstly, it seems as though Jim's acting days are a thing of the past, while he also struggled throughout the making of the film. However, perhaps with the technology today, he'd have an easier time while wearing less make-up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nonetheless, the experience was unbearable at first, so much so that he was willing to relinquish his salary and be replaced by someone else.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Producer Brian Glazer discussed the details</a>, and it was truly unlike Jim Carrey and the way he was throughout his career. It certainly meant that the role was like no other.</p><p>Glazer reveals, "I can't do this any longer, I'm gonna give all the money back" because the experience was "torturous."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=# rel=nofollow>An Audience Member Caught A Special Moment During David Letterman's Finale Between Chris Rock And Jim Carrey During The Commercial Break</a></span></p><p>To Glazer's credit, he wouldn't let Carrey walk off the film and instead, put the actor in touch with a close CIA agent. Things worked out, but it was quite the struggle for Jim behind the scenes, and a makeup artist on the film can also attest to that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-carrey-39-s-make-up-artist-had-a-negative-experience-with-the-actor-during-the-grinch>Jim Carrey's Make-Up Artist Had A Negative Experience With The Actor During The Grinch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jim-carrey.png><p>Kazuhiro Tsuji is an Oscar-nominated make-up artist, who has worked on several sets. However, his experience of working with Jim Carrey was not a positive one. Speaking with Vulture, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tsuji reveals that Jim was difficult with everyone on the set.</a></p><p>“Once we were on set, he was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn’t finish,” he said.</p><p>“After two weeks we only could finish three days’ worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart. We couldn’t shoot anything.”</p><p>Things got so toxic with Jim, that the artist actually had to leave the set for a week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In the makeup trailer he just suddenly stands up and looks in the mirror, and pointing on his chin, he goes, ‘This color is different from what you did yesterday.’ I was using the same color I used yesterday. He says, ‘Fix it.’ And okay, you know, I ‘fixed’ it. Every day was like that.”"</p><p>Credit to Tsuji who ended up returning to the film, and things were fine with Carrey once he returned. Though the artist did admit he checked into therapy following the film, which helped his life for the better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dnL%2BqusKhZJqknaTAtXnCmqysnZRit6q5jJyYq6qVrnq1u4ywmKWjXaSzp3nToZxmq5WpeqK6w2aeoq6VYq6tuIyhoKxlo5a5or7YZpmam5tk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-one-film-that-almost-caused-jim-carrey-to-walk-off-the-set-and-willingly-give-all-his-salary-ba.html&text=The%20One%20Film%20That%20Almost%20Caused%20Jim%20Carrey%20To%20Walk%20Off%20The%20Set%2c%20And%20Willingly%20Give%20All%20His%20Salary%20Ba&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-one-film-that-almost-caused-jim-carrey-to-walk-off-the-set-and-willingly-give-all-his-salary-ba.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-one-film-that-almost-caused-jim-carrey-to-walk-off-the-set-and-willingly-give-all-his-salary-ba.html&title=The%20One%20Film%20That%20Almost%20Caused%20Jim%20Carrey%20To%20Walk%20Off%20The%20Set%2c%20And%20Willingly%20Give%20All%20His%20Salary%20Ba" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-one-film-that-almost-caused-jim-carrey-to-walk-off-the-set-and-willingly-give-all-his-salary-ba.html&title=The%20One%20Film%20That%20Almost%20Caused%20Jim%20Carrey%20To%20Walk%20Off%20The%20Set%2c%20And%20Willingly%20Give%20All%20His%20Salary%20Ba" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-one-film-that-almost-caused-jim-carrey-to-walk-off-the-set-and-willingly-give-all-his-salary-ba.html&title=The%20One%20Film%20That%20Almost%20Caused%20Jim%20Carrey%20To%20Walk%20Off%20The%20Set%2c%20And%20Willingly%20Give%20All%20His%20Salary%20Ba" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-one-film-that-almost-caused-jim-carrey-to-walk-off-the-set-and-willingly-give-all-his-salary-ba.html&description=The%20One%20Film%20That%20Almost%20Caused%20Jim%20Carrey%20To%20Walk%20Off%20The%20Set%2c%20And%20Willingly%20Give%20All%20His%20Salary%20Ba" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-brady-shares-sweet-tribute-to-best-mother-and-wife-gisele.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Brady Shares Sweet Tribute to 'Best Mother and Wife' Gisele">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./patrick-warburton-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Patrick Warburton Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
