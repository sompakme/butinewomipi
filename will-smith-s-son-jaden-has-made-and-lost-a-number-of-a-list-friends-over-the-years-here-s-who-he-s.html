Jaden and August have a pretty interesting history together - here's exactly what they've done together.</p><p>Per Jojo Crews, Smith and Alsina met as actors for the unaired TV show Brothers in Atlanta. After that, they would attend music festivals and Hollywood parties together. Naturally, things went downhill after all the drama that transpired. However, if it wasn't for what was once a pretty close friendship between those two, perhaps Will and Jada's relationship troubles would have gone differently.</p><p>August has been kept out of the limelight for the most part <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since he revealed he had a boyfriend in 2022</a>.</p><h2 id=is-jaden-smith-friends-with-tyler-the-creator><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Is Jaden Smith Friends With Tyler, The Creator?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rapper-tyler-the-creator-and-kendall-jenner.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith has become really close to rapper Tyler, the Creator. They've been friends for some time, but over the last few years, things have gotten so good between them that some fans believe they may have been in a relationship at some point.</p><p>According to Distractify, Jaden and Tyler were seen hanging out back in 2013. Then, in 2015, Smith tweeted out "I Think I'm In Love With You" to Tyler on his birthday. At that time, most fans believed the two were innocently messing with each other. However, Tyler confessed a few times on his albums "Flower Boy" and "Igor" that he's seriously into guys in a romantic way, once again sparking rumors of a fling between him and Smith.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jaden then said at a concert in 2018 that Tyler is his "boyfriend", something that Tyler would deny later on social media and in an interview with Nardwuar. Regardless, they are certainly close friends with each other, even if they aren't exactly dating. <a href=#>Tyler is friends with other A-list celebrities such as Kendall Jenner</a>, so it shouldn't be a surprise he's pretty close to Jaden.</p><h2 id=is-jaden-smith-friends-with-kid-cudi><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Is Jaden Smith Friends With Kid Cudi?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kanye-West-And-Kid-Cudis-Recent-Feud_-Explained.jpg><p>Kid Cudi is famously friends with celebrities such as Kanye West, Selena Gomez, and even Timothee Chalamet.
