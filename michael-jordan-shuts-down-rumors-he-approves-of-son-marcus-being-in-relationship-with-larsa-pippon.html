As such, the two have known one another for decades. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">given the contentious nature of the relationship between Michael and Scottie now</a>, it is likely that Michael does not want to make matters worse with Marcus dating the reality star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The relationship between Scottie and Michael is "at best, strained." This comes from not only the rivalry between the two former Chicago Bulls players but from the way Scottie was portrayed in the 2020 docuseries, The Last Dance.</p><p>"I don't think it was that accurate in terms of really defining what was accomplished in one of the greatest eras of basketball," Scottie explained. "But also by two of the greatest players — and one could even put that aside and say the greatest team of all time. I didn't think those things stood out in the documentary. I thought it was more about Michael trying to uplift himself and to be glorified."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Michael Jordan's Son, Marcus?</a></span></p><p>Between this latest strain on the relationship between the two former NBA players and the way that it is portrayed that Marcus and Larsa met, it is no wonder that there is no desire for Michael to witness Marcus and Larsa in a romantic relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-marcus-jordan-and-larsa-pippen-got-together>How Marcus Jordan And Larsa Pippen Got Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/off-the-air-larsa-pippen-instagram-everything-larsa-pippen-has-said-about-her-romance-with-marcus-jordan.jpg><p>Most assume that because Michael and Scottie played together on the Chicago Bulls, Marcus grew up around Larsa. That, however, is not the case. It was not until much later that the two formally met. And when they did, the relationship grew from a friendship into something more over time, the two explained during a recent podcast, according to Us Weekly.</p><p>"There’s a lot of misconceptions and public interest with regard to our relationship," Marcus explained during his podcast, Separation Anxiety. "The podcast just gives us a platform to clear the air, put things into our own voice and just set the record straight, I guess."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I feel like people think that we’ve known each other for a long time," Larsa explained.

"We’ve got a lot of mutual friends also, and so it kind of gradually happened over time."</p><p>Regardless of how the two met, it is clear that Marcus' family is not happy about the romantic relationship between himself and Larsa. Just how this is going to play out in the future is anyone's guess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecmoqZ2ZnmLAqcHTrGSdp6ejerPBzKiprGWYmnqivM%2Brpq%2Bdo2K8p3nSqKVmpZGnsLa%2FjJucoqaXYravedGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWSwoaSdeq2t0ayYZqiZpb2wuo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-jordan-shuts-down-rumors-he-approves-of-son-marcus-being-in-relationship-with-larsa-pippon.html&text=Michael%20Jordan%20Shuts%20Down%20Rumors%20He%20Approves%20Of%20Son%20Marcus%20Being%20In%20Relationship%20With%20Larsa%20Pippon&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-jordan-shuts-down-rumors-he-approves-of-son-marcus-being-in-relationship-with-larsa-pippon.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jordan-shuts-down-rumors-he-approves-of-son-marcus-being-in-relationship-with-larsa-pippon.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%20Shuts%20Down%20Rumors%20He%20Approves%20Of%20Son%20Marcus%20Being%20In%20Relationship%20With%20Larsa%20Pippon" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-jordan-shuts-down-rumors-he-approves-of-son-marcus-being-in-relationship-with-larsa-pippon.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%20Shuts%20Down%20Rumors%20He%20Approves%20Of%20Son%20Marcus%20Being%20In%20Relationship%20With%20Larsa%20Pippon" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jordan-shuts-down-rumors-he-approves-of-son-marcus-being-in-relationship-with-larsa-pippon.html&title=Michael%20Jordan%20Shuts%20Down%20Rumors%20He%20Approves%20Of%20Son%20Marcus%20Being%20In%20Relationship%20With%20Larsa%20Pippon" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-jordan-shuts-down-rumors-he-approves-of-son-marcus-being-in-relationship-with-larsa-pippon.html&description=Michael%20Jordan%20Shuts%20Down%20Rumors%20He%20Approves%20Of%20Son%20Marcus%20Being%20In%20Relationship%20With%20Larsa%20Pippon" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rebbi-rosie-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rebbi Rosie Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lo-bosworth-dating-jeremy-globerson-he-s-very-nice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lo Bosworth Dating Jeremy Globerson: &amp;quot;He's Very Nice&amp;quot;">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
