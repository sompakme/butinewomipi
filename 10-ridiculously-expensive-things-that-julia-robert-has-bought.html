Here are 10 ridiculously expensive things that Julia Roberts has bought.</p><h2 id=malibu-compound---7-000-000>Malibu compound - $7,000,000</h2><p>Julia Roberts bought a house in front of another property she owns in Malibu. The award-winning actress invested $7,000,000 to create a paradise for her family, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. The purchase also ended the rumors Roberts, and her husband would get divorced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mansion has a great view of the Pacific ocean.

Some people would describe it as a million-dollar smile. However, her smile is worth <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$30,000,000</a>.&nbsp;According to several sources, the actress had her smile insured for that amount.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Have Their Body Parts Insured</a></span></p><p>Although it looks like an enormous amount, several celebrities and athletes insure their body parts.

The actress also has another <a href=#>apartment</a> ten blocks away from that one. The building dates back to 1958. The penthouse has 2,000 square feet, three bedrooms, and a fantastic terrace. Roberts put the loft back on the market in 2015, and she sold it for <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4,500,000</a>.
