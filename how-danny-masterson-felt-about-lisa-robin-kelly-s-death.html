Among them was a DUI in 2010 in North Carolina, resulting in a 12-month probation sentence. Things would only spiral even further as in March of 2012, the actress was involved in suspicion of spousal abuse with ex-boyfriend John Michas.

Nonetheless, fans are still praising Topher Grace for apparently keeping his distance from the cast during the show's run. However, Grace revealed he was still close to the cast members, he just had other priorities at the time.</p><p>"I was so messed up the first couple of years that a lot of the cast was more fun and would go out more," he said. "And I didn't even date anyone the first couple of years. I was so trying to do a good job on the show. Sometimes people will say, 'Were you not as close to them?' and it really makes me sad because they're all still great."</p><p>Without a doubt, there will be fewer mentions of Masterson moving forward by those involved on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dma6vuthmpJqrpJq%2FtLvNZp2epKRirqO71K1kraCRqXp4fNJmqqGnp2KwsHnSrZirZZyewKJ50aiZoqZdoLKtuNisZJ2dkam1cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-danny-masterson-felt-about-lisa-robin-kelly-s-death.html&text=How%20Danny%20Masterson%20Felt%20About%20Lisa%20Robin%20Kelly%27s%20Death&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-danny-masterson-felt-about-lisa-robin-kelly-s-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-danny-masterson-felt-about-lisa-robin-kelly-s-death.html&title=How%20Danny%20Masterson%20Felt%20About%20Lisa%20Robin%20Kelly%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-danny-masterson-felt-about-lisa-robin-kelly-s-death.html&title=How%20Danny%20Masterson%20Felt%20About%20Lisa%20Robin%20Kelly%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-danny-masterson-felt-about-lisa-robin-kelly-s-death.html&title=How%20Danny%20Masterson%20Felt%20About%20Lisa%20Robin%20Kelly%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-danny-masterson-felt-about-lisa-robin-kelly-s-death.html&description=How%20Danny%20Masterson%20Felt%20About%20Lisa%20Robin%20Kelly%27s%20Death" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-old-is-valeria-santos-everything-on-manolo-cardona-wife-age-wikipedia-and-net-worth-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Old Is Valeria Santos?
