Shortly after the episode's release, Hubbard double-downed on her happiness post-Radke and expressed how happy she was with her new mystery boyfriend.</p><p>With the series finale approaching, fans know the breakup between Hubbard and Radke is inevitable.

According to Bravo TV, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wants Radke to find his passion</a> and become successful on his own instead of choosing the easiest option.</p><p>"This is what Carl does.

Let's check out some of the most noteworthy moments.</p><p>Radke's work ethic has been a point of contention between the two as Hubbard stated she finds hard-working men attractive and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">does not think Radke is "crushing life,"</a></strong> according to Bravo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/carl-and-lindsay-smiling-for-photots-at-an-event.jpg><p>Shortly after the episode aired of Hubbard dissing Radke's work ethic, she shared more about the new man in her life in an episode of The Bitch Bible and how different their relationship is compared to her and Radke's. <strong>Her words were a clear diss to Radke</strong> considering it's a stark contrast to everything she said about Radke's work ethic and traits.</p><p>“He’s successful in his own field and has a great job.

The two were close friends but didn't test their romance until Season 4. However, that relationship was short-lived and they went back to being friends. Fast forward to 2021, feelings between the two friends were stirred up once again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lindsay-hubbard-smiling-for-photos-at-the-cmas.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her stint on <a href=#>Bravo's Winter House where she dropped major news</a> about a heartbreaking miscarriage, she saw the light through the tunnel with Radke and started dating for the second time.

A year later, Radke and Hubbard made things official with an on-screen proposal. Fans saw how happy the two were before going back to the house and telling their Summer House castmates.

With a wedding set in stone for November 2023, <strong>the two called it quits two months prior.</strong> Carl Radke released a statement to People explaining their separation.</p><p>"We are so incredibly sorry to all of our guests for the confusion and lack of communication. We were left trying to figure out how this all exactly happened before we could even have the opportunity to determine the path forward amongst ourselves."</p><p>Shortly after Radke's statement, Hubbard shared her own on Instagram. "My entire life and future was ripped out from underneath me and I’ve had a hard time making sense of it all - with no answers or closure on why." She later said she was "humiliated" by the way the breakup happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Audiences soon found out that their breakup was filmed,</strong> that they would see all the highs and lows of their relationship unfold on TV, and why the wedding didn't happen. Despite their hardships, Hubbard expressed that Radke "blew up" her life and she was "blindsided."</p><p>Although they canceled the wedding, Hubbard and her friends continued with her bachelorette party to celebrate friendship, as noted by People. Likewise, all the small details were already set in stone for their Mexican destination wedding. Page Six shared that guests already had flights and hotel rooms booked. Instead of letting it all go to waste, many Bravolebrities kept their travel plans and vacationed in Mexico. Summer House cast members Kyle Cooke and Gabby Prescod documented the Mexican weekend with Radke's parents. Likewise, Vanderpump Rules stars Sheana Shay and Brock Davies were seen partying with Cooke and Prescod.</p><p>Now that the breakup between Carl Radke and Lindsay Hubbard is final, and Hubbard is newly dating, fans of Summer House are wondering what Radke will do now that he's single and back to working at Loverboy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrqWdmr9utM6uqp5lnJ67pb%2FAsmShrZKXrrOwjJ2grKuVqHqmxIycmKukXaeupbfEZqWer12XvLqy0aKcp5xf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsummer-house-s-lindsay-hubbard-disses-ex-carl-radke-while-praising-her-new-boyfriend.html&text=Summer%20House%27s%20Lindsay%20Hubbard%20Disses%20Ex%20Carl%20Radke%20While%20Praising%20Her%20New%20Boyfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsummer-house-s-lindsay-hubbard-disses-ex-carl-radke-while-praising-her-new-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsummer-house-s-lindsay-hubbard-disses-ex-carl-radke-while-praising-her-new-boyfriend.html&title=Summer%20House%27s%20Lindsay%20Hubbard%20Disses%20Ex%20Carl%20Radke%20While%20Praising%20Her%20New%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsummer-house-s-lindsay-hubbard-disses-ex-carl-radke-while-praising-her-new-boyfriend.html&title=Summer%20House%27s%20Lindsay%20Hubbard%20Disses%20Ex%20Carl%20Radke%20While%20Praising%20Her%20New%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsummer-house-s-lindsay-hubbard-disses-ex-carl-radke-while-praising-her-new-boyfriend.html&title=Summer%20House%27s%20Lindsay%20Hubbard%20Disses%20Ex%20Carl%20Radke%20While%20Praising%20Her%20New%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsummer-house-s-lindsay-hubbard-disses-ex-carl-radke-while-praising-her-new-boyfriend.html&description=Summer%20House%27s%20Lindsay%20Hubbard%20Disses%20Ex%20Carl%20Radke%20While%20Praising%20Her%20New%20Boyfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tom-brady-was-noticeably-upset-when-his-bridget-moynahan-relationship-was-blasted-at-his-roast.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Brady Was Noticeably Upset When His Bridget Moynahan Relationship Was Blasted At His Roast">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./owen-wilson-s-insane-net-worth-doesn-t-make-up-for-his-troubled-relationships-and-mental-health.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Owen Wilson's Insane Net Worth Doesn't Make Up For His Troubled Relationships And Mental Health">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
