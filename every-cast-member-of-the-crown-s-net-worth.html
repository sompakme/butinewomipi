The Crown is our favorite royal family adaptation, and this season we even got a whole new cast. While we know you're probably a die-hard Margaret fan, or maybe you live and breathe Queen Elizabeth, we're sure you're also fans of the actors and actresses that bring these amazing people to the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Long Live The Queen: The Net Worth Of The Queen & The Royal Family</a></span></p><p>So, in case you're wondering who these people are, and what projects contribute to their fame, we've made a list. Here are 10 of the main actors from the show and their net worth, taken from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 id=pip-torrens---1-million>Pip Torrens - $1 Million</h2><p>Pip Torrens plays Tommy Lascelles in the first two seasons of the series. He was King George's private secretary, and then was Elizabeth's for a period of time. He actually has A LOT of acting credits under his belt, and we're actually surprised he doesn't have a higher net worth. He has recurring roles in many British shows, but he's also been in a few blockbuster films, including&nbsp;The Aftermath, The Danish Girl,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens.&nbsp;It's clear he's not new to acting, and we kind of loved his character from the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=victoria-hamilton---1-7-million>Victoria Hamilton - $1.7 Million</h2><p>This lovely lady plays the Queen Mother in the first two seasons. She actually has quite the background in theater, and she's done plenty of work with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>This Is Us: Every Cast Member's Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In case you're not a theater lover, she also has a recurring role on a handful of British series, including The Game, Doctor Foster: A Woman Scorned and Lark Rise to Candleford. In fact, she pretty much only acts for television, but we love her nonetheless.</p><h2 id=jeremy-northam---3-million>Jeremy Northam - $3 Million</h2><p>You'll remember this man as Anthony Eden from the first two seasons. He appears in 11 episodes, and plays the Prime Minister who takes Winston Churchill's place. He has also been in a few other shows, including&nbsp;Miami Medical&nbsp;and&nbsp;White Heat.&nbsp;He actually started in film, and has quite a few acting credits under his belt from the '90s. Of course, we think this role was one of his most popular, and he played it pretty darn well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=claire-foy---4-million>Claire Foy - $4 Million</h2><p>Honestly, all hail Claire Foy. Obviously, she's the Queen in the first two seasons. This series definitely made her name known to the world, and her career is only going up from there. She actually has appeared as a leading role in a few recent blockbuster films, including&nbsp;Breathe, First Man, Unsane,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Girl in the Spider's Web.&nbsp;We're totally convinced her net worth will get higher within the next few years, because this woman has so much talent and brilliance to offer.</p><h2 id=vanessa-kirby---4-million>Vanessa Kirby - $4 Million</h2><p>We're kind of love with Vanessa Kirby as Princess Margaret. While she's also been in a few television shows, she mainly has moved over to the big screen, much like Claire Foy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crown: MBTI® Of The Main Characters</a></span></p><p>You can find this bombshell in A Streetcar Named Desire, Everest, Me Before You, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, and most recently, she had a large role in Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw. She's brilliant, to say the least, and we definitely haven't heard the last from her, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-colman---6-million>Olivia Colman - $6 Million</h2><p>Olivia Colman has taken over as Queen Elizabeth for the newest season. She's also just recently made a name for herself, but she's been acting since 2000. In fact, she has a ton of acting credits, most of which are television shows. Most recently, she had a recurring role on&nbsp;Fleabag.&nbsp;If you're a movie buff, you can find her in&nbsp;Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;or&nbsp;The Favorite,&nbsp;where she also plays a Queen, and actually took home an Oscar for her incredible and mesmerizing role. We want to protect this woman at all costs, and we're sure that net worth is about to get even more impressive.</p><h2 id=tobias-menzies---6-million>Tobias Menzies - $6 Million</h2><p>This man is the new Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. However, this isn't his first television role. You might recognize this famous face from&nbsp;Outlander,&nbsp;where he appears in 24 episodes as Frank Randall.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest Paid Actors On Netflix Shows</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Or, for more medieval fans, he also plays Edmure Tully on Game of Thrones. We know you're going ah, that's where he's from! Well, you're welcome, and we definitely expect more greatness from this man. Plus, he's pretty perfect at playing Philip.</p><h2 id=matt-smith---9-million>Matt Smith - $9 Million</h2><p>Of course, we'll never forget that Matt Smith originally brought the role of Philip to life. Clearly, he actually has one of the highest net worths of the original cast, and has quite a few acting credits to prove it. In case you didn't know, for whatever reason, he's actually the doctor on&nbsp;Doctor Who&nbsp;from 2010-2014. Yeah, mind blown. He's also been in a handful of movies, but we think he's most iconic as the doctor and as our wonderfully courageous Prince Philip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-lithgow---45-million>John Lithgow - $45 Million</h2><p>John Lithgow is probably not surprisingly the highest-earning actor from the first two seasons. In fact, we're kind of surprised it isn't higher. This man has quite the impressive roster, and he even has two Oscar nominations for roles back in the '80s. More recently, you might recognize him from&nbsp;Pet Sematary&nbsp;or&nbsp;Daddy's Home 2.&nbsp;But mainly, we're most excited for this man's role in the upcoming film&nbsp;Bombshell,&nbsp;where he'll take a leading part as Roger Ailes.</p><h2 id=helena-bonham-carter---60-million>Helena Bonham Carter - $60 Million</h2><p>This brilliant and talented woman is honestly one of everyone's favorite actresses. It's not surprising that she's at the top of this list. She took over as Margaret for the third season, but she is certainly not new to acting. In fact, she's Tim Burton's favorite actress, and she works alongside Johnny Depp A LOT in his films. But most recently, she's shown us her brilliance in&nbsp;Ocean's Eight,&nbsp;where she's absolutely amazing. Of course, we also love her from the Harry Potter franchise, where she plays Bellatrix Lestrange. Honestly, just go re-watch all of her movies. We love what she brings to The Crown,&nbsp;and we're not surprised to see her net worth take the top spot on the list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things You Didn't Know About The Queen Of England</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWidppq%2FunnCmqqtZZ2auqOx0Wamn2WknbJur9GorqerXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevery-cast-member-of-the-crown-s-net-worth.html&text=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20The%20Crown%27s%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevery-cast-member-of-the-crown-s-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevery-cast-member-of-the-crown-s-net-worth.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20The%20Crown%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevery-cast-member-of-the-crown-s-net-worth.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20The%20Crown%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevery-cast-member-of-the-crown-s-net-worth.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20The%20Crown%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevery-cast-member-of-the-crown-s-net-worth.html&description=Every%20Cast%20Member%20Of%20The%20Crown%27s%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jeff-bezos-hands-cnn-commentator-van-jones-a-100-million-gift.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeff Bezos Hands CNN Commentator Van Jones A $100 Million Gift">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./angela-lewis-net-worth-how-much-is-angela-lewis-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angela Lewis Net Worth  How Much Is Angela Lewis Worth?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
