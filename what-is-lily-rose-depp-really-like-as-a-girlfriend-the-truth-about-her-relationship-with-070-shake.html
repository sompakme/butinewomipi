Was she always destined for a career in show business? Perhaps, so when she landed a role in The King, no one was shocked. She and Timothee Chalamet are believed to have bonded when cast on the film n 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During their reported relationship, they were photographed together on several occasions, including sharing a kiss in New York City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/timothee-chalamet-and-lily-rose-depp.jpg><p>An Us Weekly insider commented on the kiss, telling the publication, "They were pretty playful and flirty with each other" and looked like "a new young couple in love."</p><p>Paparazzi caught another of their special moments, and this was when they were on a yacht in Capri, Italy. Despite their obvious hangouts, neither star made an official statement about their time together, and their dating timeline remains unclear. That said, they did appear to have fun.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lily-rose-depp-and-timothee-chalamet.jpg><p>Chalamet also seemed to have high praise for Depp as he hinted at their relationship in an interview with GQ magazine. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I was on this boat all day with someone I really loved</a>, and closing my eyes, I was like, indisputably, 'That was great,'" he said of the yacht trip. So, what do we know about their time together? Well, the couple were in love, and both appear to be incredibly passionate about the people they are with.

Well, for starters, he doesn't like that word. "Date is very much a scary word, because then that context has been established," he said in a 2018 interview with W Magazine. "You can always see people on early date behavior."</p><h2 id=who-is-lily-rose-depp-dating-now>Who Is Lily-Rose Depp Dating Now?</h2><p><a href=#>Lily-Rose Depp has been linked to 070 Shake</a> (whose real name is Danielle Balbuena). Their relationship is still new, as they were only connected in 2023. However, they appear to be incredibly happy together. There is also something different about their time together: Depp has shared photos of her girlfriend on social media (a decision she had never made before).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Depp has been someone to shy away from confirming relationships, and she has been wary about sharing her life with fans (and rightfully so). But she confirmed their relationship in March in a move no one saw coming. She did this by posting a photo of them together on her Instagram story and referred to the rapper as her "crush."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lily-rose-depp-and-070-shake.jpg><p>The photo also revealed they had been together for four months (and appear to be still going strong at the time of publication).</p><p>You won't get much from 070 Shake's social media because they don't post often, and what they have shared has been related to their music. However, Depp has been more open. She has also shared an Instagram story referring to the rapper as the "love of my life" (via People). And she's posted a photo of them kissing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Uncomfortable Way Selena Gomez's Life May Have Been The Inspiration For Lily-Rose Depp's The Idol</a></span></p><p>Then again in August, the actress shared a series of photos of her and the musician looking happy and in love.

"Growing up in a family like I did ... I always learned the importance of privacy and valuing that and keeping things just for yourself. And so that's something that I've carried on into my own career, and that's really important to me."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily-Rose Depp has spoken about how she identifies</a> in an interview with Nylon in 2016.

I was literally doing it just to say that you don't have to label your sexuality ... " she explained. "If you like something one day then you do, and if you like something else the other day, it's whatever ... because it's not set in stone. It's so fluid."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-truth-about-her-relationship-with-070-shake-and-timothee-chalamet-as-the-focus-of-the-article.jpg><p>070 Shake has also discussed her sexuality in an interview with Pitchfork. "I don't really identify myself as queer or gay or anything. I just like girls," she said. Her previous partners include Sophia Diana Lodato and Kehlani. Could this be the final relationship for both stars, and have they found their forever person? Only time will tell, but their happiness is undeniable.
