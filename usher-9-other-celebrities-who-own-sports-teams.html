Back in 2011, LeBron didn't buy the whole team, but rather a small stake in it.</p><p>He invested about $6.5 million which is an approximate 2% stake. Since then, the team has done really Go Cavaliers! well, and the value of the team has increased, as has the value of LeBron's stake. Recently, the team has won its Premier League title.</p><h2 id=justin-timberlake---memphis-grizzlies><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Justin Timberlake - Memphis Grizzlies</span></h2><p><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> is a huge fan of basketball, as we've seen over the years.
