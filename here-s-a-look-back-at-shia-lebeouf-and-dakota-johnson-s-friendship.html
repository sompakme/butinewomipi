But for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf</a> and Dakota Johnson, their similarities far outway their differences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, their&nbsp;friendship has been making headlines. In the latest issue of Marie Claire, Johnson gushed over former co-star LaBeouf. She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a>&nbsp;that he "might be the greatest actor of [her] generation". The thirty-year-old actress knows what she's talking about when it comes to acting. She is, after all, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, as well as the granddaughter of living legend Tippie Hedren.</p><p>Since filming The Peanut Butter Falcon together in 2017, the two, along with their other co-star Zack Gottsagen, have had an unbreakable bond.&nbsp;The authentic friendships created "the special sauce", as Johnson called it, needed for the film's success. However, until recently, little has been known about the pair's friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mutual-respect>Mutual Respect</h2><p>The two got close on the set of The Peanut Butter Falcon, and have remained very close since. LaBeouf <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> he "walked out of [the] project a changed man". During the time of filming, he was arrested for public drunkenness. He used his co-stars as a rock during this time, ultimately bringing the two together in ways that they may never have been otherwise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pugh Florence, Chris Pine And Shia LaBeouf To Cast In New Psychological Thriller</a></span></p><p>After the arrest, Johnson recalls feeling "very protective" of LaBeouf. She told The Ellen Show that while his journey post-arrest was tough, she believes that the arrest was ultimately "a very important" moment for the actor. Johnson appears to be right, as LaBeouf created his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best work</a> to date immediately following his legal troubles. While receiving court-mandated rehab, he began creating his highly praised film Honey Boy. There, the acting ability that Johnson mentioned is on full display.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As in all great friendships, the respect is mutual. LaBeouf stated he was "honored to be in scenes" with Johnson during their time filming The Peanut Butter Falcon. The two are romantic in the film and he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">notably referenced</a>&nbsp;Johnson as his best on-screen kiss. Because of the bond made during filming, LaBeouf <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> that they are more than friends. They are family. He had never "enjoyed filming a movie so much or been as intimately involved with the people" he was making a movie with up to that point, so it is only natural that LaBeouf and Johnson would walk away as lifelong friends.</p><p>Though their time filming together was short, the events that happened both during and immediately after were intense for LaBeouf. Through that time, he had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnson</a> to lean on as a friend and someone who could truly understand the pressures of fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=similar-struggles>Similar Struggles</h2><p>While at first glance, the pair's backgrounds may seem vastly different, fame weighed heavily on both childhoods. From a very early age, LaBeouf was acting as a means to support his family. Failure meant the possibility of losing a place to live or going without food. Johnson came from a wealthy family already emerged in the world of celebrity. While the two dealt with different consequences as a result of fame, the struggles were very similar.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened After The Disney Channel? 15 Disney Child Stars Who Pretty Much Fell Off The Radar</a></span></p><p>Since her career began, Johnson has never been one to shy away from the hard conversations. In 2019, she launched a groundbreaking podcast called "The Left Ear" where survivors of sexual assault could anonymously share their stories. Most recently, she has opened up about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her struggles</a> with depression. She described her condition as beautiful and has discovered many ways of dealing with it since being diagnosed around the age of fifteen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For LaBeouf, his mental health was a major factor in his 2017 arrest. Through counseling at his rehab facility, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his childhood. As it was left untreated for most of his life, he used unhealthy coping mechanisms which almost led to his downfall.</p><p>Through their struggles, Johnson and LaBeouf have bonded further still. For most of their lives, fame has been looming in the background in one way or another. During LaBeouf's most vulnerable moment, Johnson provided support.</p><p>The future looks bright for the duo's friendship. Johnson and LaBeouf are reportedly set to star in Olivia Wilde's next film, Don't Worry, Darling. With the two remaining so close both on and off the screen, Johnson and LaBeouf have the potential to be the next Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. Only time will tell, but as celebrity friendships go, Johnson and LaBeouf seem to be a legendary pair in the making.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Reasons Leonardo DiCaprio And Kate Winslet Are Still Friends Today</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqiecuopqRlkpawrHnArWSsoJmWeq2xwZ6mrp5dlrulecOaoqiskWK3sLTNrKanq12bv6qxzZ2qoaGgZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-a-look-back-at-shia-lebeouf-and-dakota-johnson-s-friendship.html&text=Here%27s%20A%20Look%20Back%20At%20Shia%20LeBeouf%20And%20Dakota%20Johnson%27s%20Friendship&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-a-look-back-at-shia-lebeouf-and-dakota-johnson-s-friendship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-a-look-back-at-shia-lebeouf-and-dakota-johnson-s-friendship.html&title=Here%27s%20A%20Look%20Back%20At%20Shia%20LeBeouf%20And%20Dakota%20Johnson%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-a-look-back-at-shia-lebeouf-and-dakota-johnson-s-friendship.html&title=Here%27s%20A%20Look%20Back%20At%20Shia%20LeBeouf%20And%20Dakota%20Johnson%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-a-look-back-at-shia-lebeouf-and-dakota-johnson-s-friendship.html&title=Here%27s%20A%20Look%20Back%20At%20Shia%20LeBeouf%20And%20Dakota%20Johnson%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-a-look-back-at-shia-lebeouf-and-dakota-johnson-s-friendship.html&description=Here%27s%20A%20Look%20Back%20At%20Shia%20LeBeouf%20And%20Dakota%20Johnson%27s%20Friendship" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-how-stella-mccartney-became-a-fashion-industry-icon-and-made-her-75-million-fortune.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's How Stella McCartney Became A Fashion Industry Icon And Made Her $75 Million Fortune">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ex-atlanta-cop-charged-with-murder-of-rayshard-brooks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ex-Atlanta Cop Charged With Murder Of Rayshard Brooks">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
