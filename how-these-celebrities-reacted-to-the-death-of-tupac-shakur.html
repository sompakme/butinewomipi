Sharing time in real life as well as on-screen, the Matrix Reloaded star was hit hard by the rapper’s death. On an episode of Red Table Talk, Pinkett said, "I've had a lot of loss. So many of my close friends gone. They didn't make it to 30. They didn't make it past 25. A lot of people talk about my relationship with <strong>Pac </strong>and figure that out. That was a huge loss in my life." Jada continued, "Because he was one of those people I expected to be here. My upset is more anger because I feel like he left me. and I know that's not true, and it's a very selfish way to think about it… I really did believe he'd be here for the long run.

Though “Slim Shady” later admitted he was joking, these words allegedly enraged Diddy. However, it was rapper,<strong> Joe Budden</strong> that responded to the claim. According to Joe.co.uk, Budden said, "Nothing to speculate about, nothing to talk about.

Rourke continued, "I was in Brazil making a movie; my manager called me up and said Tupac got shot in Las Vegas and I said I'm coming home. He says 'no, no, no, he's gonna be ok.'
