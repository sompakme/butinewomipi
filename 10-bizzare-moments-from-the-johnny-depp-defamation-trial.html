The Johnny vs. Amber Heard Defamation Lawsuit paints <a href=#>a bizarre and unsettling picture of the toxic relationship</a> that Amber Heard and Johnny Depp used to have.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Wendy Williams' Thoughts On Amber Heard And Johnny Depp Did Not Age Well, Here's What She Said</a></span>Secret recordings, vaping witnesses, and some interesting choices by both Heard's and Depp's attorneys are just a few of the moments that raised eyebrows or offered a moment of comic relief in a case that involves so much violence, domestic abuse, and manipulation. These are some of the most bizarre moments from the Johnny Depp trial, and they might also be some of the most bizarre moments in celebrity legal history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-heard-s-attorney-has-an-ironic-name><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Amber Heard's Attorney Has An Ironic Name</span></h2><p>Depp accused Heard of not only lying about him abusing her, <a href=#>but also claimed that he was the real victim of abuse</a> in the relationship. Who did Miss Heard choose to defend her against allegations of domestic abuse? Well, one of her attorney's names and the one who cross-examined Johnny has an unfortunate name for such a case. Heard hired a man named Ben Rottenborn to defend her. Rottenborn, yes that is his real name. It's not the guy's fault that his name is so ironic, nor does it have anything to do with the evidence in the case, but did no one in Heard's PR team catch that one?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-heard-s-lawyers-can-t-remember-which-doctor-is-which><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Amber Heard's Lawyers Can't Remember Which Doctor Is Which</span></h2><p>Heard's other lawyer, Elaine Bredehoft, had some difficulty when questioning her expert witness. Both sides have presented psychologists as expert witnesses. Depp's side brought in Dr. Curry who diagnosed Heard with Borderline Personality Disorder, while Heard brought in Dr. Hughes. Elaine Bredehoft kept calling Dr. Hughes by Dr. Curry's name during her questioning, and Hughes politely, though somewhat indignantly, kept correcting her. In Bredehoft's defense, both women are blonde, have similar heights, and have the same job, so it's an understandable mistake, but it is embarrassing that it happened in front of such a huge audience and will now exist forever online as a meme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-mega-pint-of-wine><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The "Mega Pint" Of Wine</span></h2><p>Ben Rottenborn questioned Depp about the time Depp was drinking heavily and poured himself a "mega pint of wine." Depp and the whole court raised an eyebrow in confusion because there is no such thing as a mega pint. A pint is 16 fluid ounces, or 473 milliliters. Mega, numerically speaking, means one million. Therefore, a "mega pint" would have to be 473,000 liters. Not even Johnny Depp could drink that much wine.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Johnny Depp And Amber Heard Battle It Out For Most Bizarre Trial Moment So Far</a></span></p><h2 id=amber-heard-s-accident><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amber Heard's "Accident"</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among the pile of allegations that Depp and Heard threw back and forth at each other, one disturbing one was that Heard defecated in Depp's bed as payback for one of their many arguments. The disgusting story has earned Amber <a href=#>a cruel nickname</a> from online Johnny Depp supporters, "Amber Turd."</p><h2 id=the-vaping-witness><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Vaping Witness</span></h2><p>Many of the witness testimonies were prerecorded depositions from 2021, most of which were about the 2015 incident between Heard and Depp and the Colombia Hotel Penthouse they used to share. The front desk clerk from the hotel, Alejandro Romero, recorded his deposition from his phone in his car, and as the questioning wrapped up, <a href=#>a frustrated Romero took a massive hit from his vape</a> and started driving to work. The moment got a laugh out of Depp and Heard's lawyers even apologized to the judge for that deposition. The judge was stunned and said that it was "one of the most bizarre depositions" she has ever seen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-fist-pump><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Fist Pump</span></h2><p>During Amber Heard's second day of testimony, she brought up Depp's ex-girlfriend Kate Moss and a fight the pair allegedly had when they were dating. Depp's lawyer, Ben Chu, let his jaw drop when she mentioned Kate Moss and he gave his partner a little fist pump. The moment is one of the few times that Chu showed little restraint during witness testimony.</p><h2 id=the-dismissed-journalist><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Dismissed Journalist</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Near the beginning of the trial, Heard's lawyers got one of Depp's witnesses dismissed because they told the judge she had been posting on social media about the trial. It was later discovered that this was not true because the post in question was over a year old, meaning that the witness was dismissed on false grounds. Heard's lawyers got this information from her friend, journalist Eve Barlow. When it was discovered that Barlow had lied to the judge via Heard's attorneys, and when it was discovered she was using her phone to post about the trial while in the courtroom after the judge had banned phones, Barlow was kicked out and banned from the court for the rest of the trial.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Amber Heard â€˜Bloody Lipâ€™ Pic Surfaces But Johnny Deppâ€™s Team Cries Foul</a></span></p><h2 id=the-makeup-controversy><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Makeup Controversy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Heard's lawyers claim that she used a Milani makeup kit to hide the bruises that Depp left on her. The internet exploded when the company pointed out that the makeup kit in question <a href=#>was not released</a> until after their divorce. This was a major blow to Heard's case.</p><h2 id=the-jar-of-cocaine-reference><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The "Jar Of Cocaine" Reference</span></h2><p>Heard testified that Depp had relapsed hard, was beginning to use cocaine again, and that he was doing it so much that he kept a jar of cocaine next to their bed. Depp looked confused when she brought this up and the internet was quick to meme about one of Depp's most memorable movie lines, i.e.. the scene in Pirates of The Caribbean 2 when Jack Sparrow dances around singing "I GOT A JAR OF DIRT! I GOT A JAR OF DIRT!" Heard made some serious allegations about Johnny while on the stand, but this was one of the few moments when she made him laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-wrong-time-to-object><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Wrong Time To Object</span></h2><p>In what might be one of the most embarrassing legal debacles, one of Heard's lawyers objected to his own question while cross-examining a witness. The witness was answering a question about the effect Heard's article had on Depp's career and the lawyer objected in the middle of the answer. Little FYI for any new law students reading this, you cannot object to a witness answering your own questions. That's not how any of this works.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Johnny Depp Roasted Amber Heard's Lawyer With Savage Comebacks</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZorKqlr%2BmecyopJ6mpKh6p77OpmSjp5iju7p5w56nqWWRoq%2BmvoyhnJqqlGKxprLAppitoZ%2BjerW%2ByJqjaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-bizzare-moments-from-the-johnny-depp-defamation-trial.html&text=10%20Bizzare%20Moments%20From%20The%20Johnny%20Depp%20Defamation%20Trial&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-bizzare-moments-from-the-johnny-depp-defamation-trial.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-bizzare-moments-from-the-johnny-depp-defamation-trial.html&title=10%20Bizzare%20Moments%20From%20The%20Johnny%20Depp%20Defamation%20Trial" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-bizzare-moments-from-the-johnny-depp-defamation-trial.html&title=10%20Bizzare%20Moments%20From%20The%20Johnny%20Depp%20Defamation%20Trial" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-bizzare-moments-from-the-johnny-depp-defamation-trial.html&title=10%20Bizzare%20Moments%20From%20The%20Johnny%20Depp%20Defamation%20Trial" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-bizzare-moments-from-the-johnny-depp-defamation-trial.html&description=10%20Bizzare%20Moments%20From%20The%20Johnny%20Depp%20Defamation%20Trial" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./an-inside-look-at-lily-rose-and-jack-depp-s-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="An Inside Look At Lily Rose And Jack Depp's Relationship">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./terry-hall-wife-who-is-terry-hall-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Terry Hall Wife Who is Terry Hall Wife?
