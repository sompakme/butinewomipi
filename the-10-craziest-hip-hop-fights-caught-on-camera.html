Unfortunately, we weren’t. Over the course of the last few years, we’ve seen it happen over and over and over again. Rappers haven’t just been getting into fights; they’ve also been filming their fights and posting them online as proof that their battles actually went down. And, if they’re not the ones filming them, then you can be damn sure that there’s someone else out there with a smart phone recording the action.<span id=more-103978></span></p><p>It’s an epidemic that’s taking place in hip-hop right now amongst rappers as well as others in the rap community. To show you what we mean, we hit YouTube and found <strong>The 10 Craziest Hip-Hop Fights Caught On Camera</strong>. Check out the action. Hey, guys: Can’t we all just get along?!</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Game vs. 40 Glocc<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> These two have been beefing for quite some time now. But, it’s never gotten this out of control. Last weekend, Game spotted 40 Glocc, turned on his iPhone camera, and attacked his fellow West Coast MC.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Neither. If there’s anything we’re starting to learn about these hip-hop fights caught on camera, it’s that they’re a bad look for hip-hop in general. This fight just goes to prove it. Game claims he won the fight. But, with everybody throwing shots his way right now and criticizing him for “jumping” 40 Glocc, did he really win anything? C’mon, fellas.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> 40 Glocc vs. Black Wall Street artist Menace<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> As we told you earlier, Game and 40 Glocc have been beefing for awhile. So, it should come as no surprise to hear that 40 Glocc once got into a fist-fight with one of Game’s Black Wall Street artists.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Who knows? A few different clips of the fight leaked out but none of them showed a clear winner. And, of course, both rappers claimed that they’d won the fight. So, we’ll just call this one a draw.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Charlamagne Tha God vs. Five unknown goons<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> In the short clip, you can hear one of the guys asking Charlamagne for a drop. But, before he can answer, he gets sucker punched in the back of the head and then gets up and runs away.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Charlamagne Tha God. He did get punched on camera. But, he probably did the smart thing by avoiding a bigger beatdown. No shame in that.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Lil B vs. “journalist” Lil Nico<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> This wasn’t so much a fight as it was an all-out assault. Lil B agreed to sit down and do an interview with Nico and, just as it was wrapping up, Nico—who hadn’t shown any hostility to Lil B during the actual interview—sucker punched him several times in the face and walked out of the room.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Lil B. Even though he took a few punches to the face, the fight actually helped him get his name out there even more. And, Nico came across as a jealous guy who orchestrated a weak physical attack against him. Wack. He later put out an apology video and said that he reacted violently after Lil B told him he couldn’t call Soulja Boy to help him get signed.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Junior M.A.F.I.A. vs. Dipset<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> We’re still not 100 percent sure what started this fight. But, back in the late 1990s, Jim Jones and Cam’Ron got into a confrontation with some of the members of Junior M.A.F.I.A.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Junior M.A.F.I.A. Jim Jones took a ton of shots during this clip. But, Cam’Ron took an even bigger L when he got caught running away from the fight while it was still going on and leaving Jim behind.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> ENJ vs. Nyckz<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> In the middle of a battle, Nyckz rapped, “Oh, you mad ’cause I’m styling’ on you?” ENJ responded by sucker punching him in the face.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Nyckz. Without that line—and that punch—we probably never would have heard about Nyckz. But, because of it, we heard both his name and his catchphrase for weeks after this video was posted to YouTube.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Waka Flocka Flame vs. Some random rapper<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> At a charity bowling event in Atlanta, a man who reportedly used to be one of Waka’s artists approached him and words were exchanged. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the man punched Waka right in the face and ignited a huge brawl.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> No one. Didn’t we say this was a charity event? And, it was a charity event sponsored by Waka. So, everyone lost when a fight broke up the party early.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Kid Cudi vs. Some drunk guy<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> At a concert in Ohio a couple of years ago, an intoxicated fan ran on stage and attacked Cudi. He responded by chasing the fan off stage and punching him several times.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Kid Cudi. He had the right to protect himself—and that’s exactly what he did! Even better, he got right back on stage and finished his set once he was done.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> Kanye West and Don C vs. A cameraman<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> A cameraman attempted to take a picture of ‘Ye and his manager at Los Angeles International Airport. They asked him not to take it and, when he took it anyway, they attacked him and broke his camera.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Not Kanye. He was arrested shortly on vandalism charges and held on $20,000 bail.</p><p><br><strong>The Fight:</strong> will.i.am vs. Perez Hilton<br><strong>What Happened:</strong> After Perez reportedly told Fergie that he didn’t like her music or the Black Eyed Peas at a Hollywood party, will.i.am confronted Perez. The blogger claimed that will.i.am then punched him several times and gave him a black eye. It’s hard to see in this clip, but you can see all the commotion that the two celebrities caused.<br><strong>The Winner:</strong> Ummm…Let’s just say that if we’re at the point where will.i.am and Perez Hilton are fighting, there are no winners! We all lose.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX2Z9bq%2FRmrGinaOpeqm1z2afqKhdm7aotNOsZJyZpZy1tXnCmqSeqpFifnF%2FmHBvaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-craziest-hip-hop-fights-caught-on-camera.html&text=The%2010%20Craziest%20Hip-Hop%20Fights%20Caught%20On%20Camera&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-craziest-hip-hop-fights-caught-on-camera.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-craziest-hip-hop-fights-caught-on-camera.html&title=The%2010%20Craziest%20Hip-Hop%20Fights%20Caught%20On%20Camera" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-craziest-hip-hop-fights-caught-on-camera.html&title=The%2010%20Craziest%20Hip-Hop%20Fights%20Caught%20On%20Camera" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-craziest-hip-hop-fights-caught-on-camera.html&title=The%2010%20Craziest%20Hip-Hop%20Fights%20Caught%20On%20Camera" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-craziest-hip-hop-fights-caught-on-camera.html&description=The%2010%20Craziest%20Hip-Hop%20Fights%20Caught%20On%20Camera" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-todd-boehly-wife-family-salary-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Todd Boehly?
