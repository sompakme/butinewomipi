A gig that started in 2007, when Carey took over the hosting duties of The Price Is Right over from Bob Barker, who decided to retire after hosting the hit game show since 1972.</p><p>While some had their doubts that Carey would be able to fill Barker's shoes, he has done well with his hosting duties. Instead of trying to replace Barker, Carey has made The Price Is Right his own. But just how much cash has Drew Carey pulled in from his hosting duties, and how does he rank against other hosting greats?</p><p>Here's how Drew Carey's net worth stacks up against others in the industry (and how he built it up in the first place).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated January 2024:</strong>As the new year begins, so does another season of 'The Price Is Right After Dark'. The game show began in 2023 and is also hosted by Drew Carey. As such, Drew may be expediting his timeline to becoming the richest game show host of all time, pulling double duty on both The Price Is Right, of which Season 52 premiered in September 2023 and The Price Is Right After Dark.

Instead, he was widely recognized as an actor, and in fact, some people had reservations about him taking over on The Price Is Right. He also edged out an actress that a lot of people wanted to see nab the role.</p><p>But as it turned out, Drew was a great fit for the role, and his history on TV shows might have something to do with that. After all, Drew Carey had his own show for almost ten years, and he had a hand in producing most if not all of the 230+ episodes as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/the-cast-of-whose-line-is-it-anyway-roasted-drew-carey-in-these-edgy-moments-whose-line-is-it-anyway-_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Cast Of Whose Line Is It Anyway Roasted Drew Carey In These Edgy Moments">The Cast Of Whose Line Is It Anyway Roasted Drew Carey In These Edgy Moments</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The cast of Whose Line Is It Anyway seems to delight in mocking the show's host Drew Carey.</p><p>Drew was also on Whose Line Is It Anyway for ages, which was another way he was well-prepared for the game show hosting gig that would come later.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-drew-carey-paid-per-episode>How Much Is Drew Carey Paid Per Episode?</h2><h3 id=drew-carey-is-paid-1-million-per-episode-of-the-price-is-right>Drew Carey is paid $1 million per episode of The Price Is Right</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar48194487-1.jpg><p>After many years in the industry, Drew now commands a high salary per episode of any show he appears on. But sources suggest he earns at least $1 million per episode on The Price is Right. Those earnings alone, which started back in 2007, explain Drew's massive wealth.</p><p>But since he has producing, writing, and acting credits on his resume for most of the shows he's been on, that likely helped round out his earnings.

He was 82 at the time of his passing and had a long list of shows under his belt, including Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy.</p><p>The thing is, Drew Carey is only in his 60s at this point, which means he may have a lucrative future yet ahead of him.
