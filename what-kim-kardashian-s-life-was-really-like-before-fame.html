She has built an illustrious career as a model and media personality throughout the years. After all, she has her mother, <strong><a href=#>Kris Jenner</a></strong>, to thank for the Kardashian-Jenner empire.

Thanks to her Hollywood network, she befriended Paris Hilton and became her personal stylist, worked for R&B star <a href=#>Brandy</a> before that infamous credit card case and got involved in a high-profile Hollywood scandal. Here's a slight look at Kim Kardashian's life before the fame, before KUWTK, and what's next for the supermodel.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-attended-an-elite-roman-catholic-all-girls-school><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kim Kardashian Attended An Elite Roman Catholic All-Girls School</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born in 1980 to a wealthy family of Robert (a world-renowned lawyer) and Kris Kardashian, young Kim and her sisters got access to some of the country's most elite high schools. She, Kourtney, and Khloe attended independent Catholic all-girls Marymount High School, in which she became a part of the class of 1998.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2018, she held a reunion party for the class of '98, and it was an absolute nostalgia trip. She said, "So my friends are worried that we're going to run into people that they were mean to... <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I feel so good about my conscience, I was so nice to everyone</a>."</p><h2 id=where-kim-kardashian-worked-before-becoming-famous><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Where Kim Kardashian Worked Before Becoming Famous</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By 1996, Kim Kardashian, aged 16 at the time, landed her first-ever paid job at a clothing store in Encino, California, called Body. At the time, she'd just crashed her car, and her father Rob made her sign a contract that said she'd be responsible for any future damages. What eventually started as a way to discipline her ended up becoming her workplace in the next four years.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I always was working. I never asked people for money. </a>That was never really my thing. I always just figured it out," Kim recalled in an interview with Teen Vogue. She added, "The way that my parents taught me was, â€˜Hey, when youâ€™re 18, youâ€™ve seen this lifestyle, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re going to want to upkeep it. If youâ€™re going to want to live this way youâ€™re going to have to get a job."</p><h2 id=when-kim-kardashian-became-a-personal-stylist-for-brandy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>When Kim Kardashian Became A Personal Stylist For Brandy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2003, Kim Kardashian worked for Brandy Norwood, an R&B singer and the sister of fellow rapper Ray J, as her personal stylist. The "Afrodisiac" also employed her sister, Khloe, as a personal assistant. It's believed that the three were friends thanks to Kim's relationship with Ray J, whom she was dating at the time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Robert Kardashian Really Believe OJ Simpson Was Innocent?</a></span></p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-39-s-lawsuit-with-brandy-norwood><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kim Kardashian's Lawsuit With Brandy Norwood</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Kim Kardashian and Brandy's relationship went south after Kim and Khloe allegedly made over $120,000 in unauthorized purchases from Brandy's American Express credit card at the Kardashians' now defunct-boutique stores Dash and Smooch. The singer's mother, Sonja, took the matter to the courtroom. The Kardashians denied the allegations, but the proofs said otherwise. They settled the lawsuit in 2009 out of the courtroom in an "undisclosed settlement."</p><p>"Apart from them stealing money from my family, we would probably still be together now," Ray J told the DailyMail. He added, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">But when that happened, I said I donâ€™t want to be sleeping around with you no more</a> â€“ you stole money from my family. So thatâ€™s why we stopped speaking."</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-39-s-appearance-in-paris-hilton-39-s-39-the-simple-life-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kim Kardashian's Appearance In Paris Hilton's 'The Simple Life'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same year, Kim K. began working for her childhood friend Paris Hilton in her then-latest reality show, The Simple Life, as her stylist alongside Nicole Richie. It spanned over five seasons and 55 episodes and chronicled the life of the two socialites as they struggled to do low-paying jobs like fast-food restaurant servers and camp counselors. For Kim, however, it became an important cornerstone in her entertainment career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think There Are Certain Similarities Between Kim Kardashian And Marilyn Monroe</a></span></p><h2 id=that-infamous-x-rated-tape-with-ray-j><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>That Infamous X-Rated Tape With Ray J ...</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2007, an X-rated tape of Kim Kardashian and her then-boyfriend Ray J depicting them having an intimate steamy time was leaked to the internet. Kim was relatively unknown prior the time of the tape's leak, except for being Paris Hilton's stylist for Fox and E!'s short-lived The Simple Life reality series. It was a massive scandal back in the days, especially considering that Ray J was a big name in music and Kim's status in the entertainment industry. Many have accused Kris and the Kardashians of fabricating the "leak" story for fame, but they vehemently refuted it.</p><h2 id=did-kanye-west-recover-the-tape-from-ray-j><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Did Kanye West Recover The Tape From Ray J?</span></h2><p>This year though, Kim Kardashian's ex-husband <strong><a href=#>Kanye West </a></strong>had apparently gotten the original tape back from Ray J. On an April 2022 episode of Hulu's The Kardashians, Kim told her mother and her sister <strong><a href=#>Khloe </a></strong>that the rapper recovered the forbidden tape that catapulted her to stardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He got me all of the sex tapes back," Kim says. "And he flew home, and he got the computer it was on and the hard drive. He met up with Ray J at the airport."</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-kim-kardashian><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For Kim Kardashian?</span></h2><p>So, what's next for Kim Kardashian? Surely, her Keeping Up With the Kardashian days are long gone, but its Hulu successor is doing quite well so far. In addition to that, she's also been keeping herself busy with her shapewear company Skims and her KKW Beauty line. Speaking of her personal life, however, she's been the center of the messy divorce process from Kanye West, as she continues to date comedian Pete Davidson.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#>Did Travis Barker Move To Calabasas To Date Kim Kardashian?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYriquYykmKuckai1qq3NrGSloZaaerit0mapnpmcocZuuMiknGaalZu8s7GMn5imnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-kim-kardashian-s-life-was-really-like-before-fame.html&text=What%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Life%20Was%20Really%20Like%20Before%20Fame&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-kim-kardashian-s-life-was-really-like-before-fame.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-kim-kardashian-s-life-was-really-like-before-fame.html&title=What%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Life%20Was%20Really%20Like%20Before%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-kim-kardashian-s-life-was-really-like-before-fame.html&title=What%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Life%20Was%20Really%20Like%20Before%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-kim-kardashian-s-life-was-really-like-before-fame.html&title=What%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Life%20Was%20Really%20Like%20Before%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-kim-kardashian-s-life-was-really-like-before-fame.html&description=What%20Kim%20Kardashian%27s%20Life%20Was%20Really%20Like%20Before%20Fame" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./caelynn-miller-keyes-bio-net-worth-affair-boyfriend-dating-age-facts-wiki-height-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caelynn Miller Keyes  Bio, Net Worth, Affair, Boyfriend, Dating, Age, Facts, Wiki, Height, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-deaths-of-sean-diddy-combs-label-co-founders-spark-questions-about-his-cassie-scandal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Deaths Of Sean &amp;quot;Diddy&amp;quot; Combs' Label Co-Founders Spark Questions About His Cassie Scandal">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
