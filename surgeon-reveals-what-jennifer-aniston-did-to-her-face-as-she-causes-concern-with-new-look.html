The process typically involves injecting an enzyme called hyaluronidase to break down the hyaluronic acid-based fillers, allowing the body to reabsorb and eliminate them naturally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“[It] could be associated with filler that is migrated, or it could also represent obstructed lymphatics, which doesn’t allow fluid to leave her under eye area,” Truesdale continued to explain Jen’s seeming puffiness. “This can be seen with chronic filler use and can contribute to an overall puffy look that we call ‘filler fatigue.’”</p><h2 id=aniston-is-private-about-the-work-she-rsquo-s-had-done>Aniston Is Private About The Work She’s Had Done</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/courteney-cox-and-jennifer-aniston.jpg><p>There may be another explanation for Aniston’s more gaunt look – aging.
