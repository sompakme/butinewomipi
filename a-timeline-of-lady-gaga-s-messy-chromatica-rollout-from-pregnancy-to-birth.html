We should’ve known from the moment Gaga tweeted that she’s “<a href=#>pregnant</a>” with the album that things were only going to get weirder. A whole pandemic, <a href=#>an ex-girlfriend</a>, and even <a href=#>Target</a> came out of the woodwork and threatened to derail Chromatica’s moment. A dance album set on a fictional world is exactly the escape we could use right now. To recap, here’s a timeline of LG6’s chaotic journey, which also kind of doubles as a quarantine calendar, for those of us who have lost track of time.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckai6nqqq001b3h63qjp4bzop@published data-word-count=33><strong>March 12, 2019</strong>: Lady Gaga confirms that her sixth album is officially on the way with <a href=#>a sarcastic tweet</a>. “Rumors I’m pregnant?” she wrote. “<a href=#>Yeah, I’m pregnant with #LG6.</a>” Congratulations, it’s a chart-topper!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckai6o0dn001k3h63lxitx7bx@published data-word-count=87><strong>October 1, 2019:</strong> Lady Gaga <a href=#>dedicates LG6</a> to the pengest ting this side of the Atlantic, <a href=#>Adele</a>. “I’m calling my next album ADELE,” she tweeted one afternoon. With the glaring clarity of time, we know now that Gaga considers this album to be hugely emotional, despite the dance beats. She told Zane Lowe on <a href=#>Apple Music’s New Music Daily</a> radio show that she was “miserable, sad, depressed,” and “cried constantly” while making Chromatica. If Gaga’s getting emo, we’d bet there were many long nights weeping to 25.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckai6o0dt001l3h63hca3mmkw@published data-word-count=44><strong>January 18, 2020:</strong> What was I doing on this day?

(He and Gaga were first spotted together over New Year’s; Polansky is Lady Gaga’s first confirmed relationship after she ended her engagement with talent agent Christian Carino.) An investor and tech entrepreneur who went to Harvard, Polansky doesn’t seem like the type to devote his all to the dance floor, but if he’s making Gaga happy, then he’s an important part of Chromatica history still.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckai6o0dv001p3h636xm4rsbx@published data-word-count=49><strong>February 25, 2020:</strong> Mother can’t stay mad at her Little Monsters.

In an interview with Zane Lowe, Gaga was surprisingly chill about it. “These records got passed around to so many different people,” she told New Music Daily with Zane Lowe on Apple Music, in an interview shared shortly after the song’s release. “There were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me,” she said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckai6o0dy001s3h634m1kbf14@published data-word-count=26><strong>March 2, 2020: </strong>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage Miss Chromatica!
