During the early 1900s, the world still used pocket watches, and in 1904, <a href=#>Cartier launched the first-ever wristwatch</a>. Named after his friend, Santos became an instant phenomenon and saw its impact on Hollywood through cinema. Along with people, Cartier was also summoned to design Elizabeth II’s crown in 1910. Within a few years, innovation began growing in the women’s category, and Cartier also released the Tank watch during the first World War. From Alfred Hitchcock creating sets from Cartier pieces to Marilyn Monroe mentioning the brand during her song <i>Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend</i>, <a href=#>Cartier has always been a Hollywood favorite</a>.</p><p>There are many reasons why Hollywood has been in love with Cartier since the 1900s, from its pop cultural impact to creating jewelry that will last for generations. Let’s take a deeper look into why Cartier is Hollywood’s favorite.</p><h2 id=royalty-approved-brand>Royalty-Approved Brand</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cartier jewelry has been a staple in royal families for centuries. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, Edward VII made Cartier open a store in London in 1902 before the coronation so guests could select their preferred tiaras. He later hailed it as a jeweler of the kings. Princess Diana was often spotted wearing the Trinity ring, while Kate Middleton wore a 75-year-old royal Cartier Halo tiara at her wedding ceremony in 2011.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Most Expensive Jewelry Brands In The World, 2021</a></span></p><h2 id=excellent-style-and-craftsmanship>Excellent Style And Craftsmanship</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there have been many innovations in the jewelry house with designs and products, Cartier never fails to create its signature artistic impressions that have always been the original style of Cartier. Each jewelry and watch piece becomes an investment as long-lasting products can be handed down from generation to generation.</p><h2 id=modern-and-simple-designs>Modern And Simple Designs</h2><p>Cartier is one of the few brands that have released luxury everyday jewelry and created jewels for the red carpet and royals. In the late 1960s, the brand introduced the world to Cartier Love bracelets that represent New York from the 70s. The timeless design is available in yellow gold, white gold, and rose gold for $6,300. <a href=#>Celebrities including Jennifer Aniston</a>, Angelina Jolie, Katie Holmes, Sofia Vergara, and Mindy Kaling have been spotted wearing Love bracelets.</p><h2 id=iconic-accessories-that-have-become-timeless>Iconic Accessories That Have Become Timeless</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of its most iconic accessories is the Cartier Tank watch. It became iconic in 1926 after <i>The Son of the Sheik</i> was released and Rudolph Valentino was spotted wearing the Tank, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scmp</a>. Since then, celebrities like Clark Gable and Cary Grant have continued the legacy, and it has become a coveted honor to wear it since then.</p><h2 id=influence-on-pop-culture>Influence On Pop Culture</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cartier has been a mark of influence in market trends for a long time. Since the release of the Love Bracelet in the 60s, each product has been a step toward innovation. With the release of the Santos watch, the timeless everyday elegance made it a favorite. Louis Cartier was inspired in his everyday life to create designs, which has led to the constant popularity of the brand.</p><h2 id=a-red-carpet-staple>A Red Carpet Staple</h2><p>Any red carpet is incomplete without celebrities wearing a Cartier jewel. Cartier tries to stand out with its stunning jewels among other brands, like Harry Winston and Tiffany. Many celebrities wore Cartier jewelry at the 2022 Oscars, including Timothée Chalamet with his Panthère necklace, and Uma Thurman wore emerald and diamond earrings, as stated by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><h2 id=expansion-around-the-world>Expansion Around The World</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cartier first opened its doors to customers in Paris before expanding to London and later to New York in the early 1900s. The popularity of the branches led to an increase in sales. Over the last few years, the brand has expanded to stores in Europe and Asia, with brand ambassadors in each corner of the world to reach a grander audience.</p><h2 id=global-ambassadors-that-promote-the-fashion-house>Global Ambassadors That Promote The Fashion House</h2><p>A brand for the ages, Cartier has tried to grab the attention of younger audiences in the last few years. Jake Gyllenhaal and Lily Collins have long-standing partnerships, but new faces have joined them. <a href=#>In 2022, Cartier announced Rami Malek</a>, Maisie Williams, Willow Smith, Troye Sivan, and Jisoo from Blackpink.</p><h2 id=offering-unique-shapes-and-designs>Offering Unique Shapes And Designs</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eccentric designs have also been a part of the history of Cartier, and the unique shapes of its products have stories to tell. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, one of its most stand-out models is a Cartier Crash watch that Dan Levy wore at the 2022 Met Gala. The $1.5-million watch is a celebrity favorite, with Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams, and Kanye West each owning one.</p><h2 id=an-ever-lasting-legacy>An Ever-Lasting Legacy</h2><p>One of the most important reasons why Cartier remains Hollywood’s favorite jeweler is the rich heritage it has cultivated over the last century. From royals to celebrities, popular celebrities have been drawn to the brand for its recognition and products. Cartier is not only preserving history but also pursuing the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through its stores and online sale, Cartier has been steadily growing and has a valuation of $12.4 billion in 2022. With its increasingly global reach, the jewelry brand will continue to dominate the market. In October 2022, Cartier opened its flagship Paris store after two years of renovation, with multiple celebrities making an appearance.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look At Lil Wayne's Insane Jewelry Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scmp</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9ahsGabkafBqrHRZqCsZZikua3F1qimnatdm663u9Giq55n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-why-cartier-has-continued-to-remain-a-hollywood-favorite.html&text=Here%27s%20Why%20Cartier%20Has%20Continued%20To%20Remain%20A%20Hollywood%20Favorite&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-why-cartier-has-continued-to-remain-a-hollywood-favorite.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-why-cartier-has-continued-to-remain-a-hollywood-favorite.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Cartier%20Has%20Continued%20To%20Remain%20A%20Hollywood%20Favorite" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-why-cartier-has-continued-to-remain-a-hollywood-favorite.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Cartier%20Has%20Continued%20To%20Remain%20A%20Hollywood%20Favorite" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-why-cartier-has-continued-to-remain-a-hollywood-favorite.html&title=Here%27s%20Why%20Cartier%20Has%20Continued%20To%20Remain%20A%20Hollywood%20Favorite" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-why-cartier-has-continued-to-remain-a-hollywood-favorite.html&description=Here%27s%20Why%20Cartier%20Has%20Continued%20To%20Remain%20A%20Hollywood%20Favorite" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kayla-erin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kayla Erin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./donald-trump-paid-melania-how-much-for-her-political-support.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Donald Trump Paid Melania How Much For Her Political Support!?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
