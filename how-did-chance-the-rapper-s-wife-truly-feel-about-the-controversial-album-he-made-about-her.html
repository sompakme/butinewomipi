As they embarked on this odyssey towards matrimony and parenthood, Chance embraced the challenges that lay ahead with open arms.</p><p>Parenthood soon followed as they welcomed their first child into the world—a daughter named Kensli Bennett—in September 2015, per People. This precious addition to their family brought immeasurable happiness and transformed Chance's perspective on life entirely. Parenthood thrust him into a realm where responsibility took center stage, forcing him to confront his fears head-on while embracing the joys that come with raising a child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-did-chance-the-rapper-s-wife-truly-feel-about-the-controversial-album-he-made-about-her_.jpg><p>Marriage became the cornerstone of their love story when Chance <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed to Kirsten during a Fourth of July barbecue in 2018</a>. Surrounded by loved ones and fireworks illuminating the night sky, it was an enchanting moment frozen in time—symbolic of their unbreakable unity amidst life's chaos.

From the infectious energy of hip-hop to the soulful melodies of gospel and R&B, Chance fearlessly experiments with different sounds, resulting in a perplexing yet exhilarating listening experience.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Album That Made Chance The Rapper Famous</a></span></p><p>Chance's musical style throughout the album is equally eclectic. He effortlessly switches between rapping with rapid-fire delivery and crooning with smooth melodic lines. This versatility adds an element of surprise to each track as listeners never know what musical direction he will take next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For instance, in "Hot Shower," Chance delivers playful verses filled with witty wordplay over an infectious trap beat that instantly gets heads nodding. On the other hand, songs like "We Go High" showcase his soulful vocals layered over lush instrumentation, revealing his ability to create emotionally resonant ballads.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/chance-the-rapper-jimmy-fallon.jpg><p><a href=#>Chance is known for his political activism</a>, but he mostly skirted around those topics for the most part with "The Big Day". However, Chance did tackle societal issues with remarkable lyrical content that forces listeners to confront uncomfortable truths. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Pitchfork</a>, in tracks such as "We Go High" and "Sun Come Down," he addresses topics like racial inequality and political turmoil. His evocative lyrics shed light on these pressing issues while urging listeners to take action and be agents of change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The critical reception of The Big Day was a whirlwind of contrasting opinions. Some lauded Chance for his fearless experimentation and ability to seamlessly fuse elements of gospel, hip-hop, and pop into an infectious sonic tapestry that pulsated with life. Bursting onto the scene with tracks like "Do You Remember" and "Hot Shower," Chance showcased his versatility as an artist while simultaneously challenging preconceived notions about what constitutes contemporary rap music.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Chance The Rapper And Niall Horan Actually Get Along Behind The Scenes On The Voice?</a></span></p><p>However, others found themselves perplexed by the exuberant nature of The Big Day. Critics questioned whether Chance had overindulged in his ambition, resulting in an album that lacked cohesion or direction. Some argued that his attempts at incorporating diverse musical styles ultimately led to a disjointed listening experience that left them yearning for more consistency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of fans and critics alike smeared the album for essentially being corny. The majority of fans didn't like that Chance made an album revolving around his wife and those other odd subjects, and thought the execution thereafter was supremely lackluster.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Fans Believe Chance The Rapper’s Career Is Over</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Despite these mixed reviews</a>, there is no denying the impact that The Big Day had on the music industry at large. With its release exclusively through streaming platforms rather than traditional record labels, Chance further cemented himself as a trailblazer in an ever-evolving digital landscape. By taking control of his own distribution channels, he disrupted established norms within the industry and empowered other artists to explore alternative avenues for releasing their music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-kirsten-corley-feel-about-chance-the-rapper-39-s-the-big-day>How Did Kirsten Corley Feel About Chance The Rapper's The Big Day?</h2><p>In a recent interview with Page Six, she revealed that she was initially hesitant about the project, but she ultimately came to appreciate Chance's vulnerability.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/chance-the-rapper.jpg><p>"I was definitely nervous at first," Kirsten said. "But I realized that Chance was just being honest about his feelings, and I respected that. The album was a really personal look into our relationship, and it was definitely hard to hear some of the things that Chance said," she continued. "But I also think it was important for him to share his story, and I'm glad that he did".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's all she's said about the album.
