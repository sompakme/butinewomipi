In Europe alone, there are 3 million people on the streets. In Australia and Canada, hundreds of thousands of people are homeless. Of course, the problem is much worse in poorer countries. There are over 9.5 million homeless people in Columbia and 24.4 million in Nigeria. In total, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights estimates that the world has 100 million homeless people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How do people end up on the streets? Job losses, foreclosures, unemployment, and lack of affordable housing all play a part. Social factors can also be part of the problem; domestic violence, lack of a supportive family, drug abuse, alcoholism and mental illnesses all contribute to homelessness.</p><p>Finding a solution to the homelessness problem has been hard for many cities, states and countries. The current New York mayor has a notoriously tough time reducing the number of 'cluster sites' in his city. Some cities,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Moscow, have no programs in place to fight the problem despite the numbers of homeless people growing steadily. Other cities such as Phoenix and San Francisco have put measures in place to reduce homelessness, such as newspapers which are given to the homeless population to sell and earn a living.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some cities are struggling much more than others, and some are overwhelmed by levels of poverty.

About 50% of the homeless population&nbsp;roams the streets of Athens. A high rate of homelessness in this, the home of Aristotle and Plato, is largely down to the aggressive recession that hit Greece&nbsp;during the Global Financial Crisis.</p><p>The recession hit the country hard, reducing its gross domestic product by as much as 25% and causing unemployment rates to soar to 27%. Many people have also lost their lucrative jobs. According to the Athens city hall, most of these people suffer from&nbsp;depression, with 60% resorting&nbsp;to drugs and alcohol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=14-phoenix-arizona-united-states><strong>14.

The Phoenix Rescue Mission suggests&nbsp;that the main reasons people end up homeless are foreclosures, job losses and evictions.</p><p>Social situations such as drug and alcohol addiction, mental conditions, and domestic violence also force people onto the streets.</p><p>Of&nbsp;the city’s homeless, 43%&nbsp;are reported to have mental conditions while 21% attest to abusing drugs. Almost half of first-time homeless people say that job losses and foreclosures are the main reasons for their homelessness. The state of Arizona has established the Arizona Commission for Homelessness and Housing, and the Arizona Coalition to End Homelessness, to address the issue through education, advocacy and special projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=13-san-francisco-northern-california-united-states><strong>13.
