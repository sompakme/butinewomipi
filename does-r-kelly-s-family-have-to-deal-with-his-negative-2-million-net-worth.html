However, he soon saw his account balance dwindle due to owing the IRS millions in back taxes and facing hefty legal bills when he was accused of creating and disseminating child pornography in 2002.</p><h2 id=the-negative-association-with-being-r-kelly-39-s-child><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Negative Association With Being R Kelly's Child</span></h2><p>R Kelly's daughter Joann Kelly, better known as <a href=#>Buku Abi</a>, is a singer in her own right, having relseased her album Don't Call Me in 2019. Despite her immense talent, she cannot escape the stigma of being the daughter of an alleged predator. This has led to issues with propelling her own music career, which has inevitably impacted her financial situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I definitely run across challenges — people wanting to work with me to spite him or people not wanting to work with me just because of who he is," she told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2019. "I’ve definitely come across turmoil … being judged for really no reason at all, just based off associations."</p><h2 id=r-kelly-hasn-39-t-been-paying-his-child-support><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>R Kelly Hasn't Been Paying His Child Support</span></h2><p>With a negative net worth, it should come as little surprise that R Kelly hasn't been paying his child support bills. In fact, he was sent to jail in 2019 over unpaid child support. According to reports, he owed more than $160,000 in upaid maintenance payments.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To R.

The judge cautioned the singer that he could stave off further jail time as long as he kept up with monthly payments. It is uncertain whether his family actually received this money, however, as Kelly's attorney, Devereaux Cannick, has recently claimed in court that the star's "funds are depleted."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-claims-he-can-39-t-pay-child-support-because-his-ex-wife-is-quot-destroying-quot-his-name><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Claims He Can't Pay Child Support Because His Ex-Wife Is "Destroying" His Name</span></h2><p>R Kelly's ex-wife, Drea, has been vocal in her condemnation of her former spouse, having featured prominently in the documentary exposé Surviving R Kelly. But her bravery comes at a cost. In addition to surviving the abuse she allegedly endured at the hands of the singer, she is also suffering due to his financial situation.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>R Kelly Fans Can't Believe New Court Documents Allege He Bribed Two Teen Boys</a></span></p><p>However, Kelly blames his money woes on Drea, launching an invective against her during his now infamous Gayle King interview.

How can I get paid?" he beseeched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-has-a-pot-of-gold-in-a-royalties-account-but-his-family-isn-39-t-benefiting-from-it><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Has A Pot Of Gold In A Royalties Account, But His Family Isn't Benefiting From It</span></h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago Sun Times</a> has reported that, despite his negative net worth, R Kelly has $1.5 million in a royalties account with Sony. However, his family do not benefit from this vast amount of money. This is because the money partly goes to his former landlord, who is one of his accusers, to pay off past-due rent. Subsequently, the royalties account was frozen and his family is unable to access it.</p><h2 id=he-allegedly-offered-his-brother-money-to-take-the-rap><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Allegedly Offered His Brother Money To Take The Rap</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Kelly's brother Carey Kelly, the singer offered him money to take the rap for his child pornography charges. As reported by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Metro</a>, "he was offered a car, a record deal, and $50,000 to say it was him appearing in the 27-minute-long sex tape."</p><p>But Carey Kelly refused. He claims that he told his brother, "Let me tell you something, man. You ain’t got enough money for me to say that’s me. Because it ain’t worth me selling my soul." This incident exemplifies R Kelly’s laissez faire attitude towards his finances, which has ultimately left deep wounds in the lives of his relatives.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's What We Know About R.
