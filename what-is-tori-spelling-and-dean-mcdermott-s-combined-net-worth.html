Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott are both well known in that “oh yeah, I’ve heard of them” kinda way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Tori Spelling</a> came to prominence back in the 80s and 90s when she appeared on Beverly Hills: 90210! This all became possible due to her relationship with her father and fellow series creator, Aaron Spelling. At the time of his passing, Aaron was worth a whopping $600 million, sparking questions as to <a href=#>who his fortune was left to.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much Aaron Spelling Was Worth When He Died</a></span></p><p>While you might think that Tori received a large sum of Spelling's estate, that wasn't the case at all! Not only has Tori found herself in financial scruples, but so has her hubby, Dean McDermott. As the two continue to work in the limelight, their money woes have gotten much better, leaving us all to wonder <a href=#>how much they are both worth.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on September 3, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> When it was revealed that Tori Spelling received $800,000 of her father's $600 million net worth, fans immediately wondered why. Well, it appears as if her lavish spending habits were the reason behind her receiving so little. Tori spoke about her inheritance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Vanderpump's series, Overserved</a>, claiming she should have received a few millions, which she says she could have done wonders with. Well, not only has her financial woes gotten better, but so have her and her husband, Dean McDermott's net worth. After a successful reality series, and a plethora of TV shows Dean has appeared on, the couple has managed to amass a combined net worth of $1.5 million.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-tori-spelling-inherit>How Much Did Tori Spelling Inherit?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aaron Spelling who was the mastermind behind shows such as Dynasty, Beverly Hills: 90210, Charmed, and Melrose Place, had a net worth of $600 million. Well, at the time of his passing, Aaron left behind only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$800,000 for Tori and her brother</a>, Randy. This was intentionally done as Tori is notorious for blowing through cash on extensive shopping sprees.</p><p>Luckily for Tori, her mother, with who she has had a very strained relationship, has made it clear that Tori and Dean's kids will be financially taken care of from Aaron's estate, however, the inheritance remains the same. With an array of debts and financial mistakes, fans want to know how their marriage is doing, and just how much they're worth today.</p><h2 id=infidelities-in-the-marriage>Infidelities In The Marriage</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two have one of those origin stories that make us raise an eyebrow just a little bit. Not only do we find that the beginning of the story is off, but the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current situation is a little weird too</a>.</p><p>“It was love at first sight. I fell so hard … Then I noticed he had a wedding ring… When someone asked, he pulled out photos of his children. And — oh, yeah — I had a husband too. It was fun to flirt, but I knew nothing would happen … But: Dean and I went to a bar after dinner. And we spent the night at Cartier Place. The following day when I woke up next to Dean, I had no regrets. Something was really wrong with my marriage. Not only because I slept with this guy — though that certainly wasn’t a positive sign — but because I didn’t regret it,” explains Tori Spelling about Dean McDermott.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He, unfortunately, didn’t find himself as smitten as she, and even though they rapidly got together and created a family, McDermott’s had more than a few instances of infidelity alleged against him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much Tori Spelling Received Of Aaron Spelling's $600 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-tori-and-dean-worth>How Much Is Tori And Dean Worth?</h2><p>And so is their net worth! While the millionaire price tag certainly hangs off them as a couple, they’re missing out on it as individuals. Things with Tori Spelling went awry when it was revealed that she was in a massive amount of debt. According to sources, Tori had to pay off a whopping $700,000 bill, which the IRS reportedly took from her account in order to settle the tax lien.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star later made headlines when it was revealed that she owed a large sum to American Express, too! This made it clear that Tori and Dean weren't in the best financial position, however, as time has progressed, so have their bank accounts. Tori Spelling currently has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $1.5 million</a>, says Celebrity Net Worth. This has become possible due to her work on reality TV, selling books, and venturing off into businesses of her own, which includes a jewelry line, and course, her return to Beverly Hills: 90210.</p><p>As for Dean McDermott, the actor has been working quite a lot in recent years. The star has been featured in shows such as Slasher, The Quarantine Bunch, and Pretty Hard Cases, which have allowed him to amass a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $1.5 million</a>, too!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The assets the two possess have contributed hugely to their net worth. Between the house that they’re living in and their fancy clothes and shoes, their net worths will sustain until the valuation on those are lost. Extensive social media followers help with keeping their platforms active, and allows Tori Spelling to do things like promote her books, jewelry lines, and other products; all aiding in her net worth. The most valuable thing the two of them have? Each other. The relationship is probably the biggest asset that they have in their lives. Family is valuable, even if it’s not net worth valuable!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Tori Spelling Says Some Of The Plastic Surgery Rumors Are True</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKqZYsCxsculoKefXZa7pXnDnpinZZ2Ysaa%2BzKirrWWTpLqjtc2em2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-s-combined-net-worth.html&text=What%20Is%20Tori%20Spelling%20And%20Dean%20McDermott%27s%20Combined%20Net%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-s-combined-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-s-combined-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Tori%20Spelling%20And%20Dean%20McDermott%27s%20Combined%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-s-combined-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Tori%20Spelling%20And%20Dean%20McDermott%27s%20Combined%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-s-combined-net-worth.html&title=What%20Is%20Tori%20Spelling%20And%20Dean%20McDermott%27s%20Combined%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-tori-spelling-and-dean-mcdermott-s-combined-net-worth.html&description=What%20Is%20Tori%20Spelling%20And%20Dean%20McDermott%27s%20Combined%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./15-celebrities-who-were-the-victims-of-serious-crimes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="15 Celebrities Who Were The Victims Of Serious Crimes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./steve-stevens-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steve Stevens Net Worth | TheRichest">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
