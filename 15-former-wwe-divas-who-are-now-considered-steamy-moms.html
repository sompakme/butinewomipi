There are many women who have worked for WWE over the past two decades who are now mothers and have still been able to retain their incredible looks.</p><p>There must be some incredible skin care routine or daily workout that these women rely on&nbsp;that allows them to maintain their beauty and s*x appeal, despite advancing in age and making the decision to begin a family of their own.</p><p>The women who were once part of what is considered to be WWE's most successful era of all time, The Attitude Era, are no longer the young women that they used to be, as&nbsp;many of them now have gotten married and have children. The same can be said for many of the women who came at the beginning of the PG era, who have since moved on to projects outside of WWE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following list looks at the some of the hottest women in the world who have gone on to have children following what could be considered a successful wrestling career. Some of these women are still considered to be the hottest women in the world by the WWE Universe and could easily make a return to the company in the future.</p><h2 id=tiffany>Tiffany</h2><p>Taryn Terrell, known as Tiffany in the ring, became a huge star in TNA after she left WWE back in 2010, but many of the WWE Universe will remember her as the assistant to ECW General Manager Theodore Long, before she was moved to the SmackDown roster and formed an alliance with Kelly Kelly, known as The Blondetourage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taryn is a former Knockout's Champion with Impact Wrestling, but she made the decision to leave the company back in 2016, only to reappear as part of the newly branded GFW show a few months ago. Taryn was once married to NXT Champion Drew McIntyre, but the couple divorced in 2011. The former Champion later gave birth to a baby boy called Emerson back in March 2014. She was granted leave of absence by TNA whilst she was pregnant and was able to return to the company three months after her son was born back in June 2014.</p><h2 id=eve-torres>Eve Torres</h2><p><a href=#>Eve Torres </a>was the winner of the 2007 Raw Diva Search; this was the final live Diva Search to take place on WWE TV, and Eva later was able to become a Divas Champion. Eve took quite well to wrestling and managed to rise through the ranks as part of the Women's Division quite quickly, becoming the Divas Champion in 2009, just over a year after her official in-ring debut.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eve asked for her WWE release back in 2013 because she wanted to spend more time working as an instructor for the&nbsp;Gracie Women Empowered self-defence program, something that she helps her husband with. Eve married Brazilian Ju-Jitsu practitioner Rener Gracie back in April 2014 before she gave birth to her first child, a baby boy named&nbsp;Raeven Gracie, in September 2015. Eve has recently made her return to WWE, but only as an ambassador to help the company without actually having to appear on-screen.</p><h2 id=dawn-marie>Dawn Marie</h2><p>Dawn Marie is perhaps best remembered for her time in WWE in which&nbsp;she decided to target <a href=#>Torrie Wilson</a>'s father Al as a way to get back at the former Playboy cover girl, and even went as far as to marry him in her underwear. Al later died on their wedding night as the couple were consummating their marriage.</p><p>Dawn Marie was one of the women who was signed to WWE because she was set to be used as eye candy; she never possessed any real wrestling skill, and when she asked for a leave of absence when she found out she was pregnant, WWE released her from her contract. Dawn got married in June 2005 before giving birth to her first child, a son whom she called Matthew, in December that year. Dawn later gave birth to her second child, a daughter called Katelyn Marie, in May 2009.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candice-michelle>Candice Michelle</h2><p>Candice Michelle is a former Playboy cover girl and a former WWE Women's Champion.&nbsp;She was spotted by WWE when she auditioned for the 2004 Raw Diva Search. Candice managed to climb her way through the ranks in WWE over a number of years and was the first ever Diva Search contestant to lift a WWE Championship.</p><p>Candice was released from her contract in June 2009 following a number of injuries and returns from the former Divas Champion. She married her chiropractor husband in 2005, just after she had made her main roster debut with WWE. Candice gave birth to her first daughter just a year after she left WWE in May 2010,&nbsp;AkiAnne Rose. Her second daughter, Ryumi Grace, was born in October 2012, and her third&nbsp;addition, Aloha Von Ehrlich, was born in July 2015. It seems that Candice has settled down and decided to surround herself with her own family over the past few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=trish-stratus>Trish Stratus</h2><p><a href=#>Trish Stratus</a> is perhaps the best-known women's wrestler of all time. She is certainly the most decorated WWE female wrestler in the history of the company, as she is a seven-time Women's Champion in the span of just six years, with the biggest wrestling promotion in the world. It seems that she has also decided to settle down and start a family following her retirement and her marriage to her husband Ron Fisico in September 2006.</p><p>Trish retired from WWE a week before her wedding on the 17th of September 2006. She was then inducted into the WE Hall of Fame in 2013, where she announced that she was expecting her first child. Her son Maximus was born on her seventh wedding anniversary in September 2013, before Trish later announced that she was expecting a second child. Her daughter, Madison-Patricia, was born in January 2017 and Trish is very active on Instagram, regularly sharing images of her two children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sable>Sable</h2><p>Sable is widely considered to be one of the first ever WWE Divas and is also a former WWE Women's Champion. Sable is also a former two-time Playboy cover-girl and decided to leave WWE back in 2001 before returning to the company in 2003 and officially retiring in 2004.</p><p>Sable married her first husband Wayne Richardson back in 1986, and the couple had a daughter called Mariah. Richardson then died in a drunk driving accident in 1991, and Sable moved on to marry Marc Mero in 1993. It was Mero who got Sable into the wrestling business but her popularity became a problem for their relationship, and the couple then divorced in 2004. Sable then married current WWE Universal Champion <a href=#>Brock Lesnar </a>in 2006. The couple has two sons: Turk, who was born in June 2009, and Duke, who was born in July 2010. Sable is also a grandmother, since her daughter Mariah gave birth to a baby boy back in 2012.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christy-hemme>Christy Hemme</h2><p>Christy Hemme was the winner of the first WWE Diva Search back in 2004 and earned herself a contract with WWE. She posed for Playboy magazine whilst she was still working for WWE, before later moving on to pursue a career with TNA amidst rumors of an affair with <a href=#>Vince McMahon</a>.</p><p>Christy was voted the knockout of the year back in 2006, and worked for TNA for more than a decade as a backstage interviewer, ring announcer, and part-time knockout, whilst also having a number of brief stints on the Independent Circuit. She announced her departure from Impact Wrestling back in April 2016 after more than 10 years with the company. &nbsp;Christy married Charley Patterson while she was still under contract with TNA, and she later announced the arrival of her first child, a daughter called Charley Rose, in January 2015. Earlier this month, Christy revealed that she was pregnant again, but this time she is expecting quadruplets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michelle-mccool>Michelle McCool</h2><p>Michelle McCool is another former female wrestler who was first spotted by WWE when she competed in the 2004 Raw Diva Search. Michelle was later signed by the company, despite not winning, and she debuted as part of the SmackDown roster later that year.</p><p>Michelle went on to become both WWE Women's and Divas Champion before she was part of a "Loser Leaves WWE" match with her former teammate, Layla, at Extreme Rules in 2011. Michelle walked away from the company to spend more time with her family. Michelle married her second husband,&nbsp;<a href=#>The Undertaker</a>, in 2010, after both The Undertaker and Michelle divorced their first spouses back in 2006 and began dating each other instead. A few months after Michelle's WWE departure, it was announced that Michelle was expecting her first child. She gave birth to her daughter, Kaia Faith, in August 2012. Kaia is The Undertaker's fourth child and McCool's first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beth-phoenix>Beth Phoenix</h2><p>The Glamazon Beth Phoenix certainly made an impact in WWE as one of the most dominant additions to the WWE Women's Division in that era. Beth was just the second woman to enter a Royal Rumble match back in 2010, on top of&nbsp;holding both the WWE Women's and Divas Championships during her tenure.</p><p>Beth made the decision to leave WWE in 2012 and gave her notice to the company, citing family reasons. It was later revealed that Beth had been dating 11-time World Champion <a href=#>Edge</a> for a number of months, and the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter called Lyric Rose, in December 2013. Their second daughter, Ruby Ever, arrived in May 2016, less than a year before Beth was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Beth became the youngest ever inductee at just 36 years-old, and she and Edge became the first ever real-life couple to both be inducted into the Hall of Fame earlier this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stacy-keibler>Stacy Keibler</h2><p><a href=#>Stacy Keibler </a>is perhaps best remembered by the WWE Universe for her long legs,&nbsp;which became her trademark throughout her time in WWE. Stacy was never really used as a wrestler by WWE and was instead seen as more of a valet for the likes of The Dudley Boys and Hurricane Helms during her tenure.</p><p>Stacy was known to wrestle a number of gimmick matches, like wearing bra and panties or&nbsp;dressed as a school girl, but she was never really taken seriously by the company and after a stint on Dancing with the Stars, Stacy officially parted ways with WWE in 2006. Since her departure, Stacy has been linked with a number of romantic partners, most notably&nbsp;<a href=#>George Clooney</a>, who she dated up until 2013. Stacy then began to date Future Ads CEO Jared Pobre, and the couple married in March 2014 before their daughter, Ava Grace, was born later that year in August 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristal-marshall>Kristal Marshall</h2><p>Kristal Marshall was a contestant in the 2005 Raw Diva Search, which was eventually won by Ashley. Kristal placed fourth in the competition and was still signed by WWE and placed on their SmackDown brand where there were no titles to fight for at the time, so Kristal had an ongoing feud with the only woman on the roster at the time, Jillian Hall.</p><p>Kristal was then used in a storyline with SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long, before she was released from her contract in 2007. Kristal and <a href=#>Bobby Lashley</a> met whilst they were both working for WWE, and they dated from 2007 until 2010, when they announced that they had parted ways. The couple has a son called Myles, who was born in July 2008, and a daughter called Naomi, who was born in 2011. Kristal and Lashley appeared together on TNA TV for a while in 2010, but the storyline ended when Lashley left the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-massaro>Ashley Massaro</h2><p>Ashley Massaro won the 2005 Raw Diva Search, and was then sent to train in OVW with many other Diva Search contestants, before she later made her way to WWE TV. She was integrated into storylines that also included Candice Michelle, Trish Stratus, Victoria and Torrie Wilson.</p><p>Ashley posed for the cover of Playboy magazine back in 2007, and the attention from the cover gave her the chance to step into a feud with Melina, which&nbsp;gave the duo a one-on-one match at WrestleMania 23. Ashley left the company&nbsp;the following year, in July 2008, after she requested her release so that she could look after her daughter, who was sick. Ashley's daughter, Alexa, was born in July 2000 and was eight years old at the time that Ashley asked for her WWE release. Ashley has since spent her time raising her daughter and exploring all other avenues of employment outside of the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sara-lee>Sara Lee</h2><p>Sara Lee was the female winner of the 2015 version of Tough Enough when it returned on the WWE Network. Sara was signed to a developmental contract that lasted for a year following her win, and was sent to the Performance Centre to train, and then to NXT to become part of the roster.</p><p>Sara Lee began dating NXT star Wesley Blake back in 2015, and in 2016, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child together. Sara was released from the year-long contract that she signed in 2016, and their daughter Piper was born on May 1st, 2017. Wesley Blake is still being repackaged by WWE and is set to return to the NXT roster in the near future, but it seems that he has been enjoying his time away from TV as he celebrates the birth of his daughter. Wesley's Instagram is full of pictures of the newborn baby.</p><h2 id=brooke-tessmacher>Brooke Tessmacher</h2><p>Brooke Tessmacher is a former TNA Knockout's Champion, and&nbsp;she made a much bigger name for herself in TNA than she ever did whilst she was under contract with WWE. Brooke was part of the Raw Diva Search back in 2006 that was later won by Layla, but she was still signed by WWE and assigned to the ECW roster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brooke Adams, as she was known at the time, became a member of Extreme Expose along with Layla and Kelly Kelly, before ECW became seen as a flop and WWE decided to draft a number of stars over to their main roster. Brooke wasn't one of the people who made it to the main roster, and instead made the switch over to TNA. Brooke left TNA in 2016, when it was revealed that she was pregnant with her first child. Brooke is engaged to personal trainer Weston Wayne Piper, and the couple welcomed their first child, a son called Jace, in September 2016. Brooke made a one-off returned to TNA earlier this year, but she later stated that her contract had run out, and she was unsure if she would ever return to the company full-time.</p><h2 id=queen-sharmell>Queen Sharmell</h2><p><a href=#>Booker T</a> and Queen Sharmell are perhaps one of the best-remembered couples on WWE TV, from when Booker T became King of the Ring back in 2006. Sharmell was always seen as a valet more than a wrestler and never actually trained to be a wrestler in WWE whilst she was there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sharmell and Booker T asked for their WWE releases in 2007, due to scheduling conflicts, and they later had a brief stint with TNA. The couple officially married in February 2005 and Sharmell became the stepmother to Booker's son, Brandon. Booker and Sharmell welcomed twins in August 2010, a boy and a girl. Booker T has since returned to WWE as a commentator in their Raw roster, but Queen Sharmell has remained away from WWE and is a stay at home mother to their two children. Sharmell's last WWE appearance was when she appeared alongside her husband at the 2013 Hall of Fame induction ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2bvLO5xKtksK%2BVYrGqwsCsZLCgn2Kus7GMp6awZZOku7S1w56pnpxdqMGmrcyyZKannah8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-former-wwe-divas-who-are-now-considered-steamy-moms.html&text=15%20Former%20WWE%20Divas%20Who%20Are%20Now%20Considered%20Steamy%20Moms&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-former-wwe-divas-who-are-now-considered-steamy-moms.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-former-wwe-divas-who-are-now-considered-steamy-moms.html&title=15%20Former%20WWE%20Divas%20Who%20Are%20Now%20Considered%20Steamy%20Moms" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-former-wwe-divas-who-are-now-considered-steamy-moms.html&title=15%20Former%20WWE%20Divas%20Who%20Are%20Now%20Considered%20Steamy%20Moms" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-former-wwe-divas-who-are-now-considered-steamy-moms.html&title=15%20Former%20WWE%20Divas%20Who%20Are%20Now%20Considered%20Steamy%20Moms" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-former-wwe-divas-who-are-now-considered-steamy-moms.html&description=15%20Former%20WWE%20Divas%20Who%20Are%20Now%20Considered%20Steamy%20Moms" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./azealia-banks-noel-gallagher-and-countless-celebrities-loathe-taylor-swift-s-boyfriend-matt-healy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Azealia Banks, Noel Gallagher And Countless Celebrities Loathe Taylor Swift's Boyfriend, Matt Healy:">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-ronan-the-truth-about-the-boy-who-inspired-taylor-swift-s-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is 'Ronan'?
