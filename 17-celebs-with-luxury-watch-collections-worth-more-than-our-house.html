There are various answers to this question, mostly depending on which gender the question is directed toward. For women, it would probably be a necklace or a purse, while a nice car&nbsp;might be more suitable for a man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is one thing that both men and women desire to own. It is considered to be a standard item for displaying luxury and wealth. I am, of course, talking about watches. As a hardcore fan of this accessory, I thought that writing an article about them would be great.&nbsp;Some celebrities own watch collections that are essentially worth more than&nbsp;our houses. As much as we write about celebs and their fancy mansions and private yachts, not enough attention is paid to their watches.&nbsp;Watches are real investment pieces that can be worth thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of dollars.</p><p>So without further delay, let’s jump right into this list. Since Conor McGregor was the inspiration for this piece, let's start with him first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=conor-mcgregor>Conor McGregor</h2><p>The majority of professional athletes make tons of money on a regular basis. As a result, obtaining expensive items is a completely natural thing to do. MMA seems to have treated Mr. Notorious very well. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Conor McGregor</a> uploaded this picture to his Instagram account wearing two Rolex watches and a Patek Philippe around his wrist.</p><p>From left to right, an approximate cost of the watches you see is $20,000 (Rolex Cosmograph Daytona), $65,000&nbsp; (Patek Philippe Nautilus), and $62,000 (Rolex Oyster Perpetual Day-Date). These three watches cost more than $150,000 combined. Conor has a ton of other watches, which&nbsp;collectively cost more than $2.5 million!</p><h2 id=carmelo-anthony>Carmelo Anthony</h2><p>Being an NBA superstar comes with some pretty good benefits, one of&nbsp;which being a multimillion-dollar salary.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carmelo Anthony</a>&nbsp;has a salary upwards of $25 million per year. As an avid watch lover, he&nbsp;owns a huge selection of Rolex, Patek Philippe, Richard Mille, Audemars Piguet, and many more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not one, but two Rolex Sky-Dweller watches are a part of this personal collection. Those two alone are worth more than $60,000. A Rolex Yacht-Master II and two Day-Date watches are also some unique pieces that are pretty hard to miss. His watch collection may very well be worth more than a whole mansion, let alone a simple house.</p><h2 id=jay-z>Jay-Z</h2><p>Apart from being married to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce</a>&nbsp;and having an enormous fan base, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z</a> seems to have much more on his plate than most of the other idols in the music industry. One of the things that make him so interesting is his watch collection. Sure, Rolex and Richard Mille are part of this collection but there is a specific piece you may not have seen him wear that much.</p><p>I am talking about his Hublot piece. Hublot is one of the most exclusive watch brands in the world and one of the most expensive,&nbsp;to say the least. Beyonce gifted her beloved husband a $5 million Hublot watch! If you thought money can't&nbsp;buy happiness, think again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-sheen>Charlie Sheen</h2><p>Charlie Sheen has given hundreds of funny lines on the TV show, Two and a Half Men,&nbsp;but we nearly had a heart&nbsp;attack when we learned how much his watch collection was worth. One of his most expensive pieces is a Patek Philippe Re.2438/1, which is worth approximately $700,000!</p><p>This specific brand seems to be his favorite, as he owns many of their products. He once lost a watch worth&nbsp;$175,000 and reacted like it was nothing. Well, I guess that if your watch collection is&nbsp;estimated to be worth $5.6 million, you wouldn’t have to worry about losing one either.</p><h2 id=kanye-west>Kanye West</h2><p>Just like Jay-Z, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> is a big fan of luxury watches. With a pretty big collection to his name, the popular rapper actually likes to give more than he takes. When his album with&nbsp; Jay-Z, “Watch the Throne,” was released, he gifted Rolex GMT Masters to the sound engineers&nbsp;to thank them for not leaking the album before it was released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is the owner of a gold Rolex Daytona, a Bape G-Shock limited edition piece, and even an all-black, completely customized Rolex Submariner. On top of all these, his collection includes a gold, eight-karat diamond Tiret, which features his face on the dial.</p><h2 id=dan-bilzerian>Dan Bilzerian</h2><p>Being good at poker is one thing but going all in with your money is another. Yep, as for the latter one, I was referring to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Bilzerian</a>’s crazy life. The playboy has uploaded Instagram pictures with hundreds of beautiful women, most of whom&nbsp;have been paid for their “services." Either way, one thing that is always visible in&nbsp;his photos is the watch he is wearing.</p><p>Bilzerian has a unique taste when it comes to watches. He loves automatic and winding ones. His most expensive piece is believed to be a Richard Mille costing $800,000! Audemars Piguet and Hublot pieces are included in his collection as well. According to him, his “cheapest” watch is worth about $40,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</h2><p>One of the best actors of our generation? Probably. A person with a great taste for watches? Totally! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is known for the passion he has&nbsp;for watches. This is one of the reasons he has become the official face of Tag Heuer. Even though there are far more expensive brands, Tag Heuer makes some pretty exquisite pieces.</p><p>I guess most of you have seen DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street, right? I don’t know if you realized it but the gold watch Leo was wearing throughout the biggest part of the movie was a Tag Heuer watch as well! He isn’t conservative when it comes to watches, which he proves by wearing a Breitling Chrono Avenger in the movie,&nbsp;Blood Diamond. If you know anything about watches, you can see why wearing a Breitling is such a good move!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-downey-jr>Robert Downey Jr.</h2><p>The Iron Man seems to prefer silver more! If you get a look at his GQ interview, you will quickly understand that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Downey Jr.</a>&nbsp;likes to make his appearances count by rocking a nice watch. This can be a Rolex, of which he has too many, to say the least or a Breitling, which is a brand that the majority of celebrities&nbsp;don't usually prefer for some reason.</p><p>The “jewel” of his watch collection has to be a Patek Philippe, which costs around $35,000 - $40,000 and was a gift from his wife. All in all, Robert sure knows how to amaze both the fans and the ladies with his style!</p><h2 id=brad-pitt>Brad Pitt</h2><p>You probably already know that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> is probably the actor&nbsp; who is most “adored by women." What you don’t know, however, is that he is the owner of a pretty sick watch collection. Unlike most of the famous Hollywood actors, Brad seems to have a bit more exquisite taste.</p><p>Sure he owns Patek Philippe and Rolex watches but he also owns pieces from other brands with some pretty strange designs. One of those is a Cartier&nbsp;that doesn’t even look like a classic watch. Instead, it emits a vibe of a bracelet, mainly due to the lack of a dial!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=usher>Usher</h2><p>What does this singer (and amazing dancer) have to offer to the world? Well, apart from his great songs, most of which were hits in the 00’s, he owns a pretty big collection of timepieces. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Usher</a>, it is not so much about the price as it is about the craftsmanship of the watch.</p><p>Based on an interview Daily Mail&nbsp;had with him almost 10 years ago, he stated that he owned more than 40 watches that he would mostly wear just for their stylish looks. Not&nbsp;a single one of his watches displayed the right time! The owner of the watch company, Tiret, is a friend of Usher's and made&nbsp;a watch for him with more than 1,000 little diamonds on the face. It was worth a bit less than&nbsp;$300,000.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise>Tom Cruise</h2><p>Not many people know&nbsp;that apart from wearing watches in his movies, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise</a> is keen of the wrist accessory in his everyday life as well. Throughout the Mission Impossible movies, he can be seen rocking various Casio watches but this is just one of the cheapest watches he has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He owns an IWC, Panerai, Omega and countless other pieces from major brands. Some of them also include a U-Boat, Anonimo Firenze, Locman, Graham, Sangdo, and a Bremont. He isn’t so much about the expensive brands but nevertheless, the watches he owns are anything but cheap. They are worth more than $500,000!</p><h2 id=daniel-craig>Daniel Craig</h2><p>This entry is very different than the other ones you will see on this list. Even though we are talking about watch collections, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Craig</a>’s collection is pretty unique. No, it isn’t because he has pieces from all the famous brands, it&nbsp;because the majority of them are from the same brand. Omega! In ancient Greek, the word “mega” meant huge and important and this is exactly the kind of vibe the James Bond franchise wants to emit.</p><p>If you take a look at Mr. Bond’s watch collection you will soon notice that Omega is the main and only star! That doesn’t, however, mean that they are cheap though.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sylvester-stallone>Sylvester Stallone</h2><p>Most people know that Stallone&nbsp;as one of the box office stars of the last century but did you know that he is a watch collector as well? In fact, he is one of the few people that promoted and helped the Italian watch brand Panerai when it was not as well known. After that, he started collecting various timepieces.</p><p>Some of them include a Rolex Submariner ($20,000), a Rolex GMT Master II ($7,500), IWC Pilot ($4,500), and Rolex Seadweller ($10,000). He even managed to find and purchase a rare Seadweller James Cameron edition watch, which he proudly presented to his Instagram fans and posed with it on his wrist.</p><h2 id=david-beckham>David Beckham</h2><p>Apart from being an amazing soccer player and a handsome man, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Beckham </a>has one more thing that the majority of his fans aren’t aware of. He has a love for watches! He likes to collect them so much that he has signed a contract with Breitling&nbsp;to introduce various new pieces to the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, he owns many Rolex watches including a Deep Seadweller, which costs at least $7,000. Furthermore, he has another Breitling and two very nice Jacob & Co pieces. Who knows? They might sign a contract with him too!</p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds>Ryan Reynolds</h2><p>The star of Deadpool may like to kid around about everything but when it comes to watches, he is as serious as it gets. It is true, ladies and gentlemen, Ryan Reynolds likes to collect and wear timepieces so much that he has even become the global brand ambassador for Piaget. He actually owns a Polo S model, which he will pass on to his daughter when she grows up (it even has her initials engraved on the back).</p><p>There are even rumors about him owning a Patek Philippe Sky Moon Tourbillon, which is worth around $1.85 million. It is visible on his wrist during&nbsp;parts of the movie,&nbsp;The Hitman’s Bodyguard, and various forums have attempted to figure out whether he does or doesn’t own it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-hart>Kevin Hart</h2><p>The stand-up comedian turned actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Hart</a> seems to know how to efficiently spend the millions he makes. During an interview he had with Haute Time, he showed off his collection and shared his opinion&nbsp;on the prestigious accessories.</p><p>According to Kevin, watches aren’t about the bling they bring to the table. It is more about the value of specific brands and models that will keep their value throughout the years. This can be a Rolex, a Patek Philippe, a Richard Mille, or even an Audemars Piguet. Take a look at his Instagram profile and you will easily notice that he is constantly wearing a watch. He loves them!</p><h2 id=vladimir-putin>Vladimir Putin</h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vladimir Putin</a> has a net worth might as well easily surpass the $50 billion mark, his annual salary is about $115,000. Well, his official salary that is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you know anything about watches and you take a look at his collection, you might see why his collection is worth over $700,000. Do you want a $60,000 Patek Philippe? He’s got it. Do you want $500,000 A. Lange & Sohne? He has one. Putin would have to spend almost 5 years of&nbsp;his salary to buy this one piece.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZ2KwprjEm6pmr5mptW641LGsq7FdrK61r8dmmqiknJqwtbXOp6pmr5%2Bnwal5zKipnmWkna6vec6uqWagn6rApns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f17-celebs-with-luxury-watch-collections-worth-more-than-our-house.html&text=17%20Celebs%20With%20Luxury%20Watch%20Collections%20Worth%20More%20Than%20Our%20House&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f17-celebs-with-luxury-watch-collections-worth-more-than-our-house.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f17-celebs-with-luxury-watch-collections-worth-more-than-our-house.html&title=17%20Celebs%20With%20Luxury%20Watch%20Collections%20Worth%20More%20Than%20Our%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f17-celebs-with-luxury-watch-collections-worth-more-than-our-house.html&title=17%20Celebs%20With%20Luxury%20Watch%20Collections%20Worth%20More%20Than%20Our%20House" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f17-celebs-with-luxury-watch-collections-worth-more-than-our-house.html&title=17%20Celebs%20With%20Luxury%20Watch%20Collections%20Worth%20More%20Than%20Our%20House" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f17-celebs-with-luxury-watch-collections-worth-more-than-our-house.html&description=17%20Celebs%20With%20Luxury%20Watch%20Collections%20Worth%20More%20Than%20Our%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alison-moyet-net-worth-therichest.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alison Moyet Net Worth | TheRichest">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paolo-gucci-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Paolo Gucci Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
