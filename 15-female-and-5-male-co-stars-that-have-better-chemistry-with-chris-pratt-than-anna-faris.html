He is also set to star in&nbsp;the upcoming, highly-anticipated&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War, as well as the Jurassic Park franchise motion picture title,&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.</p><p>Although Pratt has managed to maintain his lovable, dorky personality while transitioning into these megastar, protagonist roles, he wasn't able to hold onto all aspects of his previous, comedic life. Chris Pratt and his former wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Faris</a>&nbsp; shockingly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to split</a>, seeming to be unable to manage their marriage anymore, with Chris breaking into huge Hollywood roles, and Anna Faris remaining at home more frequently with their child. The couple each posted on their social media pages, stating they were&nbsp;sad and disappointed to announce they were legally separating, and that they had tried for a long time to make it work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chris Pratt and Anna Faris met while filming&nbsp;Take Me Home Tonight, another hilarious feature film starring Chris Pratt in a goofy role. Pratt&nbsp;claimed in interviews that after first meeting Faris he knew that she was the one he wanted to be with. In 2008, Pratt and Faris moved forward from their friendship into a more serious, loving relationship, and eventually married in 2009. While the two had immediate chemistry from their first roles together, Pratt&nbsp;moving into the spotlight drew extensive attention from the media, who was now obsessed with the new, 6-pack Pratt.</p><p>Casting recently has&nbsp;landed Pratt&nbsp;next to more and more&nbsp;gorgeous, Hollywood starlets (and handsome stars),&nbsp;with&nbsp;the public seeing his&nbsp;on-camera&nbsp;chemistry with numerous other performers&nbsp;in his more recently-released&nbsp;movies. Even though it was previously off boundaries for the married father-of-one to speculate on&nbsp;which of his co-stars he has the best chemistry with,&nbsp;the high-profile, celebrity is now single and ready to mingle, and it's almost too easy to picture potential celebrity, co-star matches.&nbsp;Here are 15 female (and 5 male) co-stars that have better chemistry with Chris Pratt than Anna Faris:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aubrey-plaza>Aubrey Plaza</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubrey Plaza</a>, though already acclaimed for her role as April Ludgate in the television show&nbsp;Parks and Rec, recently achieved massive international recognition for her award-winning performance in&nbsp;Ingrid Goes West. In Parks and Rec as April Ludgate, Plaza plays the&nbsp;eccentric love-bird of Chris Pratt, who plays Andy Dwyer. After&nbsp;dumping his previous girlfriend Anne Perkins, played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rashida Jones</a>&nbsp;to be with Aubrey Plaza, the two go on to form an adorably immature, but stronghold relationship.&nbsp;Pratt and Plaza undoubtedly&nbsp;made a comedic power-couple in the series, displaying on-screen awkwardness that had&nbsp;audiences praying for the formation of some kind of real life romance. Even the outtakes of the show exemplified the chemistry between the two, with&nbsp;Chris Pratt even owning up to getting aroused after&nbsp;Plaza slapped him when their characters are roleplaying in one of the show's nightclub scenes.</p><h2 id=zoe-saldana>Zoe Saldana</h2><p>With their first encounter in the movie Guardians of the Galaxy starting as a heated hand-combat fistfight, the on-camera&nbsp;tension between Chris Pratt and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoe Saldana</a>&nbsp;was an instant appeal&nbsp;to&nbsp;viewers of the film, and had them&nbsp;drooling&nbsp;over Pratt and Saldana's romantic scenes&nbsp;in the movie. Chris Pratt, who plays Peter Quill in the 2-time Oscar-nominated feature,&nbsp;time-and-time again has his advances rejected by Zoe Saldana, who plays the cold but sexy Gamora. Zoe Saldana is an award-winning and nominated actress who has starred in box-office successes such as&nbsp;Star Trek,&nbsp;Colombiana and&nbsp;Avatar, and is no amateur to action-star roles. The two have also revealed in radio and press interviews to have a certain off-camera chemistry, additionally reported to have caused Anna Faris discomfort watching the relationship between Gamora and Peter Quill on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bryce-dallas-howard>Bryce Dallas Howard</h2><p>The 2015 release of Jurassic World&nbsp;saw enormous international box-office sales of over $1.6 billion. In the commercially successful motion picture,&nbsp;Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard star as Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, two individuals with a heated past and lustrous future. The two gave hard-going performances, with Bryce Dallas Howard seen to be running in heels&nbsp;from dinosaurs and Chris Pratt starring as a hardcore raptor-trainer, and&nbsp;undoubtedly displayed tense emotions of both hate and romance towards&nbsp; each other.&nbsp;The two worked hand in hand to take down the antagonist dinosaur, and ended up rekindling their romance to the audience's delight – but not before Bryce Dallas Howard baits a T-Rex to rescue Pratt. Talk about true love.&nbsp;The fourth&nbsp;title&nbsp;in the Jurassic Park franchise Jurassic World, will also be followed by the&nbsp;sequel,&nbsp;Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, in which hopefully Pratt and Howard&nbsp;will exhibit more of their on-screen chemistry - this time with a now-single Pratt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teresa-palmer>Teresa Palmer</h2><p>While Chris Pratt and Anna Faris famously got together in the production of Take Me Home Tonight, one cannot help but think that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teresa Palmer</a>&nbsp;and Chris Pratt may have been a better choice of a couple to be forged out of the nostalgic and hilarious movie about four friends who re-kindle old romances and friendships at a post-graduation labor day party. The beautiful Teresa Palmer stars as Tori Frederking in the movie, who ends up as the romantic love interest of Matt Franklin (played by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Topher Grace</a>). Having made her recent horror-thriller movie debut in features such as Lights Out&nbsp;and The Berlin Syndrome, Teresa Palmer would absolutely be a well-rounded potential mate for Pratt, who has also shown his ability to perform in both comedic and serious roles.</p><h2 id=rashida-jones>Rashida Jones</h2><p>At the start of the series Parks and Recreation,&nbsp;Chris Pratt and Rashida Jones play the obviously incoherent couple of Andy Dwyer and Anne Perkins, with Andy as the comedic idiot and Anne as the loyal, out of league girlfriend. Though the two were destined for a split on the show, the moments they had while still together as Andy and Anne showed that they actually had legitimate chemistry with each other as a mature couple.&nbsp;Rashida Jones has become a major influence in&nbsp;the motion picture and television industry. In addition to being an&nbsp;Emmy-nominated star&nbsp;of TV shows like&nbsp;Parks and Rec&nbsp;and&nbsp;Angie Tribeca,&nbsp;as well as being the&nbsp;writer of the upcoming&nbsp;Toy Story 4 Pixar production,&nbsp;Jones is the&nbsp;executive producer of the documentary series&nbsp;Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On. Her current amassed fame&nbsp;is similar&nbsp;to&nbsp;Pratt's rise-to-stardom, and the two would&nbsp;have irrefutably excellent&nbsp;chemistry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox>Megan Fox</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox</a> is one of Hollywood's most established actresses for her sexy and seductive roles in numerous, globally-distributed productions, including the commercially successful&nbsp;Transformers from Michael Bay.&nbsp;However, one&nbsp;of Megan Fox’s most notorious roles in movies was as the hot-teenager-turned-demon Jennifer in the comedy-horror feature Jennifer’s Body. In it, Megan Fox plays the s*xually charged best friend of Needy who is transformed into a demon by a ritualistic band seeking fame, and&nbsp;begins making meals of the men she sleeps with. Prior to turning demon, Megan Fox encounters her old fling Roman (Chris Pratt), in which she reveals that the two had previously engaged in some illustrious "fun" together. In the few moments they share together exchanging witty insults and banter, the tension is strong between the two, and it is undeniable that Chris Pratt and Megan Fox would hit it off instantly in an onscreen (or offscreen)&nbsp;romance.</p><h2 id=haley-bennett>Haley Bennett</h2><p>In the recent remake of the action-adventure western The Magnificent Seven, Chris Pratt starred as Josh Faraday, active gambler and magic enthusiast. In the movie, Pratt’s character, as well as six other members of “The Magnificent Seven”, are hired by beautiful widow Emma Cullen, who is played by Haley Bennett. Pratt and Bennett share a&nbsp;few tense scenes together, one specifically where Chris Pratt attempts to be a teacher-figure to Bennet, and “teaches” her about using a gun and how to deal with killing somebody. Though a brutal and intense scene, one can't help but feel something a little bit more than rage coming from both Pratt and Bennett. Even when the cameras weren't rolling the two had&nbsp;skeptically-flirtatious moments during publicity campaigns for the western-adventure remake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-chastain>Jessica Chastain</h2><p>In the Oscar Award-winning feature Zero Dark Thirty, the story of the intense and harrowing hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, Chris Pratt makes an appearance as Justin, alongside the gorgeous Oscar Award-nominee <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Chastain</a>, star of such esteemed motion pictures as The Help and The Martian. Both Pratt and Chastain have shown to be versatile in a variety of genre roles, and both delivered&nbsp; impressive performances in the award-winning production. The two exchange&nbsp;fiery, heated moments with each other, given Pratt's character's position in the military and Chastain being in charge of orders. As Chris Pratt questions Jessica Chastain’s character over the legitimacy of her Intel regarding the location of Bin Ladin, shots showing Pratt and Chastain together on screen show that the two may have more to offer each other outside of their prescribed character lines.</p><h2 id=rachel-bilson>Rachel Bilson</h2><p>In the hit drama series, The O.C, Chris Pratt plays Che, a laid-back, lesser-intelligent character of the series. One of the main storylines surrounding Pratt’s character was his friendship with Summer Roberts – played by actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel Bilson</a>. In the popular television drama, which ran for 4 seasons, Che influences Summer Roberts' illegal, activist activities, and ends up getting her suspended from Brown University. While on the show, Chris Pratt acts as a sort of antagonist to Rachel Bilson’s character, causing her entire life to turn to ruin. Despite their imminent character fallouts, the two pair exceedingly well together in photographs and on camera – and one can’t deny while watching the show that these two would definitely hit it off if they were to pursue anything off the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alison-brie>Alison Brie</h2><p>In one of the more popular rom-com flicks of the decade, The Five-Year Engagement, Chris Pratt stars as Alex Eilhauer, best friend to professional chef, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Segel</a>. In the movie, Chris Pratt ends up falling for and marrying Suzie Barnes, played by the award-winning star of the popular Netflix series Glow, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alison Brie</a>. Suzie Barnes is the sister of Jason Segel’s fiancé, Violet Barnes (played by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emilie Blunt</a>), which ends up causing multiple instances of delightful awkwardness and tension in the movie. The two depict a super charged and electrifying romance onscreen, including a&nbsp;few instances in which they both sing&nbsp;to one another in Spanish - a moment that has people clutching their stomachs with laughter. The couple's&nbsp;sultry singing duets featuring minutes of unbroken, sensual eye contact, are undeniably indicative of the&nbsp;chemistry&nbsp;that Mr. Pratt and his leading co-star share&nbsp;with one another.</p><h2 id=sarah-drew>Sarah Drew</h2><p>Starting off in one of his earlier roles on the Primetime Emmy-nominated series Everwood, about a widowed surgeon who moves his family to Everwood, Colorado, Chris Pratt starred in one of the recurring roles as Bright, and performed in 89 episodes of the series between the years 2002 and 2006. While on the show, Pratt’s character Bright, is in a relationship with the stunning Hannah – played by award-winning star of Grey’s Anatomy, Sarah Drew. Displaying incredible onscreen romance and beautifully-written dialogue together, the two co-stars dealt with relationship issues such as the potential of long-distance relationships, and were awed and gawked at by fans of the romantic-drama series. Those kissing sessions between the two would definitely be something for the two worth rekindling, and this time maybe out of character given Pratt's new single-bachelor status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p>Probably the most compatible on this list is the pop-culture, super starlet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence</a>. As the lead star of motion picture successes like The Hunger Games,&nbsp;Silver Linings Playbook, and&nbsp;American Hustle, as well as her incredibly award-deserving performance in the recent thriller&nbsp;Mother!, Jennifer Lawrence is definitely one of the more highly-regarded performers to top the tabloids in recent years.&nbsp;The chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt was made all too obvious when the&nbsp;two A-listers&nbsp;co-stared in the recent hit motion picture Passengers, sharing a passionate on-screen romance that was hard not to imagine continuing into the real life.&nbsp;The multiple television interviews they premiered on together in which they promoted the production also showed the&nbsp;obvious tension the two shared between one another. Furthermore, Lawrence has additionally been blamed by multiple news sources as the reason for the Anna Faris/Chris Pratt split, given Pratt and Lawrence's extremely blatant chemistry and Faris' rumored history of jealousy - scandalous!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-albrecht>Kate Albrecht</h2><p>In another one of his lesser-recognized, leading-comedic roles, Chris Pratt starred as Lester Watts in the comedy production Deep in the Valley, from AMG Entertainment. The movie tells the story of a video booth that transports&nbsp;two best friends to an alternate reality that is a world straight out of an adult film. In the movie, he stars with notable actress and writer Kate Albrecht, who has starred in such films as The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and the widely viewed comedy series Entourage. Albrecht has also starred in such productions as My Best Friend's Girl,&nbsp;Sex and The City&nbsp;and&nbsp;Will & Grace.&nbsp;Albrecht, who stars as Daphne in Deep in the Valley and is clearly no newcomer to the comedy scene, would absolutely pair better as a&nbsp;potential match for Pratt than some of the women in his past relationships.</p><h2 id=cobie-smulder>Cobie Smulder</h2><p>Another one of the more comedically-qualified candidates that would match well with Chris Pratt is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cobie Smulders</a>. The tale of Smulders is similar to Pratt's, having made her name as the hilarious and witty lead Robyn in How I Met Your Mother and transitioned to more action-packed productions, including&nbsp;The Avengers, Captain America:&nbsp;Winter Soldier and&nbsp;Jack Reacher.&nbsp;Chris Pratt stars alongside Cobie Smulder in the "dramedy" production Delivery Man, also starring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince Vaughn</a>. Cobie Smulders, who will be starring with Pratt in the upcoming Avengers: Infinity War movie, is definitely a potential candidate&nbsp;that Chris Pratt should invest his time in, given that&nbsp;Smulder is definitely no newbie to the comedy-series scene, and would most-certainly hold her own if she ever decided to take on the infamously hilarious Pratt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristen-hager>Kristen Hager</h2><p>In one of her lesser-recognized cameo-appearances, Chris Pratt takes on a starring role in the action-adventure assassin movie Wanted, additionally starring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">James McAvoy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Freeman</a>. In the movie, Pratt plays Barry, “best-friend” of James McAvoy’s character Wesley, who works alongside Wesley in his accounting firm, and during his office breaks gets it on with&nbsp;Welsey’s girlfriend Cathy – played by award-winning actress Kristen Hagen. Together Chris Pratt and Kristen Hagen share some passionately animated lovemaking scenes, creating a spicy-fling that viewers of the film couldn’t help but enjoy. Though the movie&nbsp;Wanted&nbsp;received rather poor reviews by critics, one of the more memorable aspects&nbsp;in the film was in fact the chemistry between Chris Pratt and Kristen Hagen.</p><h2 id=jason-segel>Jason Segel</h2><p>While Chris Pratt would undoubtedly pair well with numerous women in Hollywood that have proven to have exquisite chemistry with the single Chris Pratt more than former wife Anna Faris, it can also be stated that Chris Pratt would also match better with some of the men he has co-starred with. One such example is comedic legend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Segel</a>. With both Jason Segel and Chris Pratt willing to make complete mockeries of themselves on camera, from playing dimwitted characters to stripping nude on camera just to get a laugh, the two comedians definitely have a lot in common. They even starred in the comedy feature The Five Year Engagement as co-chefs and best friends, and show to be truly compatible on camera together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-brody>Adam Brody</h2><p>In one of his earlier roles as Che on The O.C, Pratt's character ends up dreaming&nbsp;of&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Brody</a>'s character on the show - Seth Cohen. Che then ends up trying to help Seth Cohen find his spirit animal on a sporadically-planned camping trip, and the two end up on a "bro-mantic," hallucinogenic trip through the forest. In another hilarious moment on The O.C, Pratt also sings naked to Brody on the guitar, showing that he is not afraid to show his true and&nbsp;full self in front of his co-star.&nbsp;Pratt and Brody have also&nbsp;starred together later in the comedy-horror feature Jennifer's Body - Brody as the demented, ritualistic band leader, and Pratt as the douche Roman. Who knows what other roles, both on and off-screen, the future may hold for these two.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper>Bradley Cooper</h2><p>Also starring alongside Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana in the&nbsp;Oscar-nominated feature film&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;and&nbsp;the hit sequel&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is 4-time Oscar-nominee <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Cooper</a>. In the movies, Pratt and Cooper throw shady insults back and forth at one another throughout the action-sequences of gun-shooting and space flight, until eventually coming to terms as friends. The demeaning comments towards one another are similar to those shared by flirtatious high school students, and can definitely be interpreted as a more teasing act than one meant to actually insult and belittle each other. Moreover, with Chris Pratt&nbsp;being nominated for Sexiest Man Alive in 2014, and Bradley Cooper winning Sexiest Man Alive by&nbsp;People Magazine in 2011, the two would make a hot couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-scott>Adam Scott</h2><p>While on the series&nbsp;Parks and Rec, Chris Pratt had electrifying chemistry with numerous cast members in his charming role as Andy Dwyer. Rashida Jones (Anne Perkins) and Aubrey Plaza (April Ludgate) were both "victimized" by the swooning hilarity that Chris Pratt emitted, but they weren't the only ones who shared remarkable chemistry with Pratt. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Scott</a>&nbsp;has become a prevalently-casted A-lister, who has starred in such hits as&nbsp;Krampus,&nbsp;Black Mass,&nbsp;The Aviator and&nbsp;Step Brothers, and has shown himself to be a truly witty and entertaining performer. While starring on the show&nbsp;Parks and Rec&nbsp;as the brilliant-minded, awkward love of Leslie Knope (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Poehler</a>), Scott became the best friend and temporary roommate of Chris Pratt's character, Andy Dwyer. While the two bashed heads a lot at the time while in character, the two definitely had something of a spark while on set together, and undoubtedly shared a real chemistry as co-stars.</p><h2 id=vince-vaughn>Vince Vaughn</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vince Vaughn</a>&nbsp;is an award-winning and nominated individual renowned for his roles in such internationally-successful productions as&nbsp;Into the Wild,&nbsp;The Breakup,&nbsp;Wedding Crashers and&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Though seeming to be working his way into more roles as a producer, with upcoming production credits on&nbsp;Wicked Lovely,&nbsp;Triple Time,&nbsp;The Rockford Films,&nbsp;The Risk Agent,&nbsp;The Insane Laws,&nbsp;Sweep, and other films currently in production, Vaughn has already established himself as a talented comedian and action-star. Vince Vaughn and Chris Pratt previously starred in the movie&nbsp;Delivery Man&nbsp;together. Both Pratt and Vaughn were great as&nbsp;co-stars, and the chemistry between them onscreen was definitely more notable than any prior performances Pratt had with Faris. The two showed absolute comfortability with each other in interviews as well, discussing their personal lives and families.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: nydailynews.com,&nbsp;cosmopolitan.com,&nbsp;msn.com,&nbsp;collider.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2bsq6ty55kmqaUYoJuucClnGabn2LAta3RrGStoJGpeqmt1Z5km52kqbKzecKhnKaho6m%2FunnWoquhZZOdv6q%2FjKmpmqykYsGprc1mmKemkWKzor7IrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f15-female-and-5-male-co-stars-that-have-better-chemistry-with-chris-pratt-than-anna-faris.html&text=15%20Female%20%28And%205%20Male%29%20Co-Stars%20That%20Have%20Better%20Chemistry%20With%20Chris%20Pratt%20Than%20Anna%20Faris&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-female-and-5-male-co-stars-that-have-better-chemistry-with-chris-pratt-than-anna-faris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-female-and-5-male-co-stars-that-have-better-chemistry-with-chris-pratt-than-anna-faris.html&title=15%20Female%20%28And%205%20Male%29%20Co-Stars%20That%20Have%20Better%20Chemistry%20With%20Chris%20Pratt%20Than%20Anna%20Faris" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f15-female-and-5-male-co-stars-that-have-better-chemistry-with-chris-pratt-than-anna-faris.html&title=15%20Female%20%28And%205%20Male%29%20Co-Stars%20That%20Have%20Better%20Chemistry%20With%20Chris%20Pratt%20Than%20Anna%20Faris" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f15-female-and-5-male-co-stars-that-have-better-chemistry-with-chris-pratt-than-anna-faris.html&title=15%20Female%20%28And%205%20Male%29%20Co-Stars%20That%20Have%20Better%20Chemistry%20With%20Chris%20Pratt%20Than%20Anna%20Faris" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-female-and-5-male-co-stars-that-have-better-chemistry-with-chris-pratt-than-anna-faris.html&description=15%20Female%20%28And%205%20Male%29%20Co-Stars%20That%20Have%20Better%20Chemistry%20With%20Chris%20Pratt%20Than%20Anna%20Faris" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-says-she-s-not-dancing-with-real-knives-in-odd-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears Says She's Not Dancing With 'Real Knives' in Odd Video">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tyra-banks-responds-to-winnie-harlow-s-antm-criticism.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tyra Banks Responds To Winnie Harlow's 'ANTM' Criticism">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
