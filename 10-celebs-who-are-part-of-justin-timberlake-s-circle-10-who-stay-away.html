He first gained fame as a member of the world-famous boy band, NSYNC. They're one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. However, it was easy to see that Timberlake had the potential to&nbsp;branch&nbsp;off on his own. Timberlake did embark on a successful solo career that made him a household name. He then began a successful film career. He's one of the most beloved stars today; fans go crazy over him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, it turns out that everyone doesn't&nbsp;love Justin Timberlake. There are a few celebs that keep their distance from him. Some are fellow artists (including some of his rivals) and even ex-girlfriends. He's had some unpleasant encounters with other celebs over the years.</p><p>Of course, there are a few celebs that love Timberlake just as much as his fans do. He has&nbsp;an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">circle</a> of famous and talented friends. The only thing more impressive is the list of celebs that can't stand him. It's time to take a closer look at JT. Here are 10 Celebs Who Are Part Of Justin Timberlake's Circle (10 Who Stay Away).</p><h2 id=kanye-west-stay-away><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Kanye West – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>It's no surprise that Kanye West isn't a fan of Justin Timberlake. West is only a fan of his own music and the music of his closest friends. The feud began when Timberlake collaborated with Jay-Z on "Suit & Tie." West praised Jay-Z's part in the song, but criticized Timberlake. Timberlake never publicly responded, but the rivalry continued. It finally came to an end when the two <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">squashed</a> the beef backstage at the MTV Music Awards</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-biel-circle><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>Jessica Biel – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>A few weeks ago, it would have been safe to say that Jessica Biel is part of Justin Timberlake's circle. They've been married for several years and are one of the most beloved couples of all time. However, photographers caught Timberlake holding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hands</a> with Alisha Wainwright and everything changed. He publicly apologized to his wife, but there's a chance that he's not part of her circle for the time being.</p><h2 id=sinbad-stay-away><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Sinbad – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>In 2018, Justin Timberlake performed the halftime show at the Superbowl. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">performance</a> garnered a divided reaction from fans and celebs. There were a few that enjoyed it but a whole lot that hated it. Comedian Sinbad was one of many that didn't like the performance. He took to Twitter to voice his opinion and had some harsh words for Timberlake. In other words, Sinbad isn't a fan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-fallon-circle><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Jimmy Fallon – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>It's no secret that Justin Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon have one of the greatest bromances of all time. They have a ton of chemistry both on and offscreen. It all started when Timberlake appeared on Saturday Night Live while Fallon was a cast member. Timberlake often performs on The Tonight Show with Fallon. The two best buddies are often spotted hanging out at events and concerts. It's a bromance that'll never end.</p><h2 id=dana-white-stay-away><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Dana White – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>UFC President Dana White isn't one to shy away from speaking his mind. Indeed, White's been in a few feuds with celebs and even MMA fighters. A few years ago, White had some harsh words for Timberlake. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According</a> to White, Timberlake was rude to White's kid backstage at a concert. White was furious and took to Twitter to let out frustration. However, Timberlake later&nbsp;called&nbsp;White and cleared up the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ben-affleck-circle><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Ben Affleck – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake might not seem like the most apparent friends. Indeed, the two became friends while working on the film,&nbsp;Runner Runner. At the time, Timberlake was starting to branch out to a film career. Teaming up with Affleck was a huge career moment. Of course, Affleck also has a big and impressive circle of friends.</p><h2 id=kathy-griffin-stay-away><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Kathy Griffin – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>As noted, Justin Timberlake's Superbowl <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">performance</a> left a lot of fans disappointed. It's safe to say that comedian Kathy Griffin is not a fan of Timberlake's music. So, it's no surprise that she hated his Superbowl performance. Like many celebs, she voiced her opinion on Twitter and had some harsh words for Timberlake. Of course, Griffin is never afraid to speak her mind, but doing so didn't bring her closer to Timberlake's circle.</p><h2 id=christina-ricci-circle><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Christina Ricci – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>Christina Ricci and Justin Timberlake go way back. The two celebs have a tight friendship and remain good friends to this day. Indeed, even Timberlake getting married didn't slow down the association. They worked together on the 2006 film,&nbsp;Black Snake Moan. It was one of Timberlake's first movie roles as he expanded his career. Timberlake and Ricci have a chemistry few friends have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cirque-du-soleil-stay-away><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Cirque du Soleil – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>Justin Timberlake has faced a few court cases&nbsp;for stealing someone else's music. In fact, several individuals accused Timberlake of stealing their material for his The&nbsp;20/20 Experience album. The band Sly, Slick, And Wicked accused him of sampling a song without permission, as did Perry Kibble.</p><p>However, Cirque du Soleil also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sued</a> him for allegedly stealing, "Steel Dream", for his single, "Don't Hold The Wall." It's safe to say he won't receive an invitation to join Cirque du Soleil.</p><h2 id=nsync-circle><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>NSYNC – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>Justin Timberlake is now one of the most successful solo artists of all time. He's released a long list of classic singles and won numerous accolades. However, it all started for him long before that. Timberlake first rose to fame as a member of NSYNC. The band members have remained friendly over the years. There have always been rumors of problems, but the band remains on good terms for the most part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janet-jackson-stay-away><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Janet Jackson – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>It's safe to assume that Janet Jackson keeps her distance from Justin Timberlake. In 2004, Jackson and Timberlake performed during the Superbowl Halftime show. The performance ended in a controversy due to Jackson's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wardrobe</a> malfunction. Timberlake let Jackson take all the heat for the incident. Jackson never performed at the Superbowl again, while Timberlake returned in 2018.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-circle><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Taylor Swift – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>Taylor Swift is one of the top-selling female artists of all time. Swift has her tight-knit circle of friends. Of course, she's also been in a few feuds with fellow celebs. Luckily, Justin Timberlake and Taylor Swift hit it off. They're both fans of each other's music and careers. However, they've only ever been friends and nothing more. Perhaps, at a different time in their lives, they could have been more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-stay-away><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Kim Kardashian – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have been in a few celebrity feuds over the years. Nowadays, if one half of Kimye gets into a dispute, the other usually joins in, too. As noted, West and Justin Timberlake feuded for years. They eventually settled their issues, but not before Kim Kardashian got involved.</p><p>Indeed, Kim and Kanye made sure to not&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">invite</a> Timberlake and Jessica Biel to their wedding. West and Kardashian&nbsp;even went as far as to ban them from the event. At the time, it was a clear sign to Timberlake and Biel.</p><h2 id=will-smith-circle><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Will Smith – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>Will Smith is one of the most influential celebs in Hollywood. He's had a successful career in music, television, and movies.</p><p>In the 90s, Smith dominated every form of entertainment. He was one of the first to successfully cross over into several different mediums. Justin Timberlake would essentially follow the same path as Smith in his career. They eventually became friends as well and formed a tight bond. They remain good friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-gosling-stay-away><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Ryan Gosling – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>Justin Timberlake got his first big break as a&nbsp;kid&nbsp;in the 90s. He was a Mouseketeer in Disney's The Mickey Mouse Club.&nbsp;Timberlake was part of the show during its golden era when it included future stars Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Keri Russell, and Ryan Gosling. Gosling and Timberlake roomed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">together</a> as kids and things didn't go great. They never clicked as friends back then and that continues to this day.</p><h2 id=conor-mcgregor-circle><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Conor McGregor – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>Conor McGregor is one of the most famous UFC fighters of all time. He's charismatic, controversial, and unapologetic. Indeed, some celebs love him, and others stay away from him. Of course, Timberlake knows what it feels like to be so loved and hated at the same time.</p><p>Timberlake is a fan of McGregor's and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posed</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;a pic with him at UFC 200. Timberlake jumped at the chance to take a pic with the world-famous megastar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=britney-spears-stay-away><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Britney Spears – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>In the late 90s, Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears were the 'it couple'. They were two of the biggest teen idols in the world. However, they had a bitter breakup that left bad feelings on both sides.</p><p>Timberlake made wild claims about Spears after the split. It was a tough breakup for Timberlake, as&nbsp;evidenced by the song and video, "Cry Me A River." Spears <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admits</a> it was one of the toughest breakups and heartbreaks she ever endured.</p><h2 id=beyonc-and-jay-z-circle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Beyoncé And Jay Z – Circle</strong></span></h2><p>For years, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have been one of the most famous power couples in the world. They've ruled over Hollywood as one of the cutest couples. Of course, they've had a few problems in the last few weeks.</p><p>Another power couple that can relate is Jay-Z and Beyoncé. Did you know the two couples are close friends and often go on double dates together? They regularly attend several significant events together, as well.</p><h2 id=prince-stay-away><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Prince – Stay Away</strong></span></h2><p>Prince is one of the greatest artists of all time. However, Justin Timberlake was never really a fan. Indeed, he had some harsh <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">words</a> for Prince over the years and didn't hide the fact that he doesn't care for his music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For years, Timberlake mocked Prince for his short stature. Of course, the situation didn't get any better. In 2018, Timberlake performed at the Superbowl halftime show and attempted to pay tribute to Prince, but it backfired. The performance and tribute received a backlash from his fans,&nbsp;who all hated every moment of it.</p><h2 id=mile-kunis---circle><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Mile Kunis - Circle&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis seem like the perfect couple. Of course, they're not a couple, but just really good friends. They have an incredible amount of chemistry but maintain they've always only been friends.</p><p>As noted, Timberlake's married to Jessica Biel while Kunis is married to Ashton Kutcher. Regardless, that hasn't stopped the rumors. They addressed the rumors during the MTV Awards and were very open. They also starred in the romantic comedy,&nbsp;Friends with Benefits,&nbsp;where their chemistry was on full display.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnPmqmtZZ%2BbeqvB0q2gp2WknrqjsdGlmKSdo2Kwqr7CpZxmaWBixKm7jKyrmrFdlsSixY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-justin-timberlake-s-circle-10-who-stay-away.html&text=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Justin%20Timberlakes%20Circle%20%2810%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-justin-timberlake-s-circle-10-who-stay-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-justin-timberlake-s-circle-10-who-stay-away.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Justin%20Timberlakes%20Circle%20%2810%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-justin-timberlake-s-circle-10-who-stay-away.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Justin%20Timberlakes%20Circle%20%2810%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-justin-timberlake-s-circle-10-who-stay-away.html&title=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Justin%20Timberlakes%20Circle%20%2810%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebs-who-are-part-of-justin-timberlake-s-circle-10-who-stay-away.html&description=10%20Celebs%20Who%20Are%20Part%20Of%20Justin%20Timberlakes%20Circle%20%2810%20Who%20Stay%20Away%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-what-david-boreanaz-has-been-up-to-since-buffy-and-angel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Here's What David Boreanaz Has Been Up To Since 'Buffy' And 'Angel'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-best-volumizing-shampoos-in-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Best Volumizing Shampoos in 2023">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
