Not to mention, the two are also parents to three boys: Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo, which meant that by ending the marriage, Stefani was also breaking up the happy family life she once thought she shared with Rossdale and the kids.</p><p>Sources claimed the Glycerine star had been romantically involved with the nanny, Mindy Mann, who lost her job shortly after Stefani found out what was going in when she wasn’t at their LA home.

I obviously know the date,” she recalled. ”It was the beginning of hell. Like six, seven, eight months of torture, trying to figure out this big secret.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She admitted to feeling like telling everybody about Rossdale’s cheating ways but she knew that in doing so, she would hurt her children immensely, so Stefani opted to pray instead.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani Sends Envy-Vibes As She Flaunts Her Perfect Life In Front Of Her Ex</a></span></p><p>"What happened was praying. That's my childhood, that's how I was raised. And I think I strayed from that. But you know when it gets that bad, you just get desperate? You're on your knees. You're like, 'What do I do?' You can't even go to your parents and ask them what to do.”</p><h2 id=did-gwen-stefani-have-a-prenup>Did Gwen Stefani Have A Prenup?</h2><p>By 2017, Stefani and Rossdale were finally able to reach a divorce settlement, five years after going their separate ways.</p><p>It should be noted that The Voice judge did not have a prenuptial agreement in place — presumably because she was convinced the marriage would last a lifetime.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘The Voice’: Ariana Grande Has Enough Star Power To Replace Blake Shelton And Gwen Stefani</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But instead of making a money-hungry attempt to seek as much money out of Stefani as possible, the pair mutually agreed to share several of their properties, along with joint custody of their three sons.</p><p>And the best part about the whole settlement was that Rossdale did not ask for child support even though he could have very well requested anywhere in the ballpark of $75,000 since he shares three children with the pop superstar, who is worth a reported $150 million.</p><p>The two agreed to an unequal split of property, a source told People, with Stefani taking the greater portion while they both agreed to 50-50 custody of their children.</p><h2 id=how-gwen-stefani-bounced-back-after-her-divorce>How Gwen Stefani Bounced Back After Her Divorce</h2><p>Divorce is never easy, but instead of dwelling on the past, Stefani decided to return to the studio and record her third album This Is What the Truth Feels Like, which was released in March 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most of the songs were said to have been written with Rossdale in mind, and while the recording process was no easy task for the momma-of-three, she looked at the procedure as being quite therapeutic.</p><p>“It’s weird how time can go so quickly, especially when you’re a mother of three boys — I went from that horrible time in my life [her 2015 divorce from Gavin Rossdale], and that was when I wrote that last record,” Stefani told <a href=#>Vogue</a>.</p><p>“My life was falling apart,” she continued. “[Writing the 2016 album] wasn’t to do with anything other than saving my own life. That’s a completely different place to be. Then halfway through [recording], I fall in love with this cowboy guy — like, what the hell?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani Vs.
