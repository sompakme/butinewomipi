The father-daughter relationship has been strained ever since he and Tish Cyrus divorced, with Miley most recently <a href=#>pointedly snubbing her dad in her speech when she won her first Grammy</a>.</p><p><strong>The country star posted a throwback to a picture of him holding baby Miley in his arms in what he called one of his favorite moments in life</strong>.</p><p>"One of my best memories ever: @cma [Country Music Association] Fest, back when it was Fan Fair. That's @mileycyrus and me, surrounded by thousands of incredible fans at the fairgrounds. The next day, someone handed me this picture, and I wrote that poem right then on the bus," he wrote. There were pictures of the handwritten poem, which the musician dubbed "The Moment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Billy Ray then went on to praise his daughter. "<strong>I’m incredibly proud of her</strong>," he stated. "She's a survivor and a true artist. She learned early on to love and appreciate the fans who make everything possible. We both cherish the connection we have with our fans and are grateful for every single one of you! Hope you all have a great Friday!

In the process, Miley allegedly aired other grievances, including issues about her addiction.</p><p>"<strong>Miley has simply had enough of her dad</strong>," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told RadarOnline after the Cyrus' divorce</a>. "Things were already tense between Miley and Billy Ray, but they had a blowup this summer. There hasn’t been a word between them since.
