In the case of Bette Midler, however, she has managed to be a respected star literally for decades at this point. With that in mind, it makes perfect sense that Midler has managed to amass a truly amazing $250 million net worth according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you ask most people that are aware of Bette Midler’s past, she certainly deserves to be included on any list of entertainment’s living legends. In fact, Julianne Moore, an actor that some people consider to be a legend herself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fangirled</a> when she costarred with Midler in The Glorias.</p><p>When you factor in Bette Midler’s celebrity status and her impressive fortune, it begs an obvious question, what is she spending her cash on? As it turns out, Midler’s financial decisions have been both awe-inspiring and touching at times.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Go Nuts For Julianne Moore's Red Givenchy Outfit</a></span></p><h2 id=a-career-for-the-ages>A Career For The Ages</h2><p>Best known as a massive movie star, Bette Midler’s Hollywood history is one that virtually any star would likely be jealous of. For example, Midler recently starred in the surprisingly successful animated movie The Addams Family and she will go down in history for another beloved family movie, Hocus Pocus. Of course, all of that is to say nothing about her other successful films including The First Wives Club, Beaches, Ruthless People, and too many more to list here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Bette Midler’s acting career, she is an incredibly accomplished singer as well. While Midler’s last album was released several years ago, her gorgeous voice played a key role in the success of many songs that have passed the test of time. For example, some of her songs like “Wind Beneath My Wings” and “From a Distance” mean so much to her fans that even thinking about them is bound to put them at ease.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hocus Pocus Gets a Virtual Reunion Just In Time For Halloween</a></span></p><h2 id=midler-s-passions>Midler’s Passions</h2><p>Throughout Bette Midler’s time in the public eye, there has never been any question that she is outspoken when it comes to the things she cares about. For example, many years after Janet Jackson’s 2004 Super Bowl performance became a subject of great controversy, Midler tweeted about her belief that Justin Timberlake <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">owes the singer an apology</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to things that really matter, Bette Midler has proven that she is happy to put her money where her mouth is. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A long time philanthropist</a>, the list of causes that Midler has supported over the years is long, to say the very least. For example, Midler has given a large amount of money to Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights First, and The Mirembe Project.</p><p>On top of those donations, Bette Midler has spent her time and money to support several more charities. Included in that list is a little known company called Smile Train which trains doctors to perform cleft repair surgeries for people who suffer from extreme poverty. Middler has also worked to support the Worldwide Orphans Foundation, a charity that “provides education, medical care and psychosocial support for communities in need”. Finally, Midler’s money has gone to Hope North, a charity that provides “a school, a home, and a promise” to Ugandan children that were forced to become soldiers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Started Their Own Charities</a></span></p><h2 id=real-estate-holdings>Real Estate Holdings</h2><p>When it comes to the possible investments that a wealthy celebrity could make, going on a real estate shopping spree seems to be extremely reasonable. After all, as has been said by a lot of people over the years, it isn’t like they are making any new land. With that in mind, the fact that Bette Midler could accurately be called a real estate mogul makes it her seem extremely intelligent. In fact, her holdings are so impressive that she can compete with some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most expensive homes that celebrities own</a>.</p><p>When it comes to Bette Midler’s real estate purchases, one of the most notable has to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Manhattan Penthouse</a> her family lived in for decades. A pair of units that were combined into one, Midler’s 7,000 square foot New York apartment took up the top three floors of a building. Said to contain 14 rooms, an outdoor landscaped terrace, a double-sized living room, and a reception gallery, the apartment also had a great view of Central Park. After spending a huge portion of her fortune to purchase and renovate the space in the mid-90s, in 2019 Midler put the apartment on the market for $50 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evidently, a huge fan of Hawaii, Bette Midler, and her husband bought several properties on an island named Kauai. In fact, even though Midler sold one of her Hawaiin homes for 12 times the amount she paid for it in 2020, she still has a lot of money invested in the area. For example, she continues to own an impressive home that sits on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">huge 38-acre property</a> in the Kilauea area of Kauai. Given how much even small Hawaiin properties cost, it is mindboggling to think of how much money Midler has invested in the area.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Nina Dobrev's LA Home</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHqpu9ZmmZ6spJp6rrXDpZyrZaOlsq%2Bw0mafnqpdZ4Jxecyio6Whn6N6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-bette-midler-spends-her-250-million-net-worth.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Bette%20Midler%20Spends%20Her%20%24250%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-bette-midler-spends-her-250-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-bette-midler-spends-her-250-million-net-worth.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Bette%20Midler%20Spends%20Her%20%24250%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-bette-midler-spends-her-250-million-net-worth.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Bette%20Midler%20Spends%20Her%20%24250%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-bette-midler-spends-her-250-million-net-worth.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Bette%20Midler%20Spends%20Her%20%24250%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-bette-midler-spends-her-250-million-net-worth.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Bette%20Midler%20Spends%20Her%20%24250%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jay-z-responds-to-accusations-of-using-anti-semitic-lyrics-on-4-44.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jay-Z Responds to Accusations of Using Anti-Semitic Lyrics on '4:44'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-kelis-get-royalties-from-beyonce-sampling-her-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Kelis Get Royalties From Beyonce Sampling Her Song?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
