In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an industry that is so deeply driven by unrealistic beauty standards</a> and the ever-present search for perfect aesthetics,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> plastic surgery is a common go-to</a> that many high profile celebrities gravitate towards. The man that many people seek when they're getting ready to go under the knife, is none other than Dr. Terry Dubrow.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The famous surgeon has worked on many high profile stars,</a> and has been quick to jump in and assist many patients that have undergone surgeries that require repair. Along with becoming famous for his incredibly successful transformations, Dr. Terry Dubrow has appeared on a number of reality television shows, and has acquired an enormous net worth of $50 million along the way. He holds the distinction of being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 3rd highest paid plastic surgeon </a>in the entire world.</p><h2 id=dubrow-s-early-days-before-fame-and-fortune>Dubrow's Early Days, Before Fame And Fortune</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard for fans to imagine Dr. Terry Dubrow doing anything aside from plastic surgery, but as it turns out, this was not his desired career when he first entered into the medical world. In fact, he had his heart set on becoming a cardiologist and wanted to specialize in surgical heart procedures. While he was pursuing his medical education, he learned of a woman whose face was badly disfigured in a car crash, and he quickly realized the benefits of plastic surgery. Motivated by the desire to help people regain their lives, Dubrow moved forward to pursue studies in the realm of plastic surgery procedures, and&nbsp; most would agree; this is the greatest re-direct his career could have seen. He is now sitting atop a massive fortune, and seems to truly love the work he does on a daily basis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmetic Catastrophe: 10 Botched Celebrity Surgeries</a></span></p><h2 id=his-plastic-surgery-skills-become-a-reality-tv-phenomenon>His Plastic Surgery Skills Become A Reality TV Phenomenon</h2><p>Terry Dubrow's career was an instant success, and he was progressing well as a deeply respected, and highly esteemed plastic surgeon. Then, an opportunity came across his path that would officially change the landscape of his life, and would forever change his entire career. He participated in the Fox reality television hit show called The Swan and fans were instantly interested in learning more about the doctor and the various surgeries he was in the middle of performing. Before long, the world was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starting to take notice </a>of his work and his undeniably charming on-camera presence, and the opportunities for him to engage in more reality based television shows began to expand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before long, Dr. Dubrow was signed on to star in what would soon become a hit show that would generate interest across the nation, a show called Botched. The premise of the show was to highlight people that have suffered from botched and unsuccessful surgical procedures that left them scarred, disfigured, and feeling completely insecure about their appearance. Dr. Terry Dubrow and his business partner Dr. Paul Nassif, were there to swoop in and save the day, performing life-altering surgeries that were designed to repair the damage done by less experienced surgeons.</p><p>Fans simply couldn't get enough of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> miraculous transformations</a> that they were witnessing at as a result&nbsp;of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dubrow's skillful surgical procedures.</a>&nbsp; The 'before' and 'after' images were dramatically different, and the show was an instant hit.</p><p>Dubrow then signed on for the spinoff show, Botched By Nature, which saw an equally impressive fan following and became the new addiction for many.</p><h2 id=his-unmatched-reputation>His Unmatched Reputation</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dubrow has gone on to participate in a number of other television specials inclusive of Bridalplasty and Good Work, and his reputation has been recognized and respected by fans across the globe. The quality of his work is unmatched in the industry, and Dubrow has been known to mastermind the most incredible results from high-risk surgeries that other doctors would hesitate to undertake.</p><p>Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the price tag associated with his surgeries reflects his skill set.</a> It's an expensive venture to be operated on by this highly esteemed doctor, and patients will have to be able to handle the sticker-shock that is associated with his procedures.</p><p>Dubrow is as much of a business mogul as he is a surgical genius. He charges a hefty price tag for his skilled work, and then moves on to later make<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an additional layer of profit by sharing the videos of the surgical transformations on reality television, </a>and cashing in on his huge reality tv paychecks as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adding yet another income stream to his already incredible fortune, Dr. Terry Dubrow has also penned a number of books, and has found great success as a published author. He has published</p><p><i>The Dubrow Diet: Interval Eating to Lose Weight and Feel Ageless,&nbsp;</i><i>Dr. and Mrs. Guinea Pig Present The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to the Best Anti-Aging Treatments,&nbsp;</i>and for those seeking more natural methods to pursue anti-ageing, Dubrow has gone on to publish:&nbsp;<i>The Dubrow Keto Fusion Diet: The Ultimate Plan for Interval Eating and Sustainable Fat Burning.</i></p><p>All of Dubrow's efforts have worked to both gain him notoriety in the public realm, and have also added layers of additional income to his already massive fortune. He and his wife, Heather, have also been featured on the Real Housewives of Orange County, and are both paid handsomely for appearing on the hit reality television show.</p><h2 id=living-in-the-lap-of-luxury>Living In The Lap Of Luxury</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Terry Dubrow and Heather Dubrow have been known to indulge in some of their hard earned money</a>. Worth a combined $100 million, this power couple has purchased an enormous, 22,000 square foot compound that they call 'home.' Interestingly, the entire property was custom designed with Heather's influence and direction, and was a complete surprise for Terry Dubrow, who left it in his wife's hands.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The mansion set the couple back a whopping $21 million</a> and includes a full movie theatre, and of course, a massive, designer shoe closet for Heather. Their home is located in California and also boasts a media room, a massive pool, an office for Heather that's designed specifically for podcasting, a private gym, and more rooms than can be counted.
