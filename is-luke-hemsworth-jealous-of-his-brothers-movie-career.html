We often forget that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Owen and Luke Wilson have a brother</a>. And for a time, before she became an MCU starlet, we had no idea that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen had a sister Elizabeth</a> lurking on the sidelines deciding if she should&nbsp;go into acting or not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hemsworth brothers</a>, Chris and Liam, who have been A-List celebrities for years now, are no different. We know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what kind of relationship they have together</a>. But what's their relationship like with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their brother Luke</a>?</p><p>They all have a bond, but Chris and Liam&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">can also get kind of competitive</a>&nbsp;with each other because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they're like twins</a> and go up for the same roles.&nbsp;On the other hand, Luke isn't competitive with his famous brothers because he likes the path he's on. It's as simple as that.</p><h2 id=luke-has-stuck-to-acting-on-tv-and-likes-it>Luke Has Stuck To Acting On TV And Likes It</h2><p>Before his famous brothers,&nbsp;Luke was the first to get into acting. Somehow, the oldest Hemsworth turned out to be the least famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Chris took on the MCU as Thor, and Liam took on The Hunger Games,&nbsp;becoming household names, Luke stayed on television. He started working in 2003, taking on Australian series like Last Man Standing, Neighbours,&nbsp;and Bikie Wars: Brothers in Arms.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Hemsworth's Best Movies According To IMDb</a></span></p><p>In 2016, he made his long-awaited "big-break" in Westworld, portraying the character Ashley Stubbs. This is Luke's biggest mainstream role, although he did play his brother's Thor in a play in Thor: Ragnarok.</p><p>Besides all of this, Luke didn't have high-profile relationships like his brothers, nor is he as inclined to share his private life as they are. He's happy to live his own life, away from the spotlight for the most part, and isn't jealous of his brother's success. If he were, he would have gone for the types of roles they've had and would have probably become famous before either of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only annoying thing is that it's hard, especially going off of his success on Westworld, to "differentiate" from his brothers. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He hates being compared to them</a> and has struggled to find his own beat in the business, despite sticking to acting on television.</p><p>He told BW magazine, "In a way, it's hard that my brothers are so-well known because (for me) there's a level that you have to hit."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Goes Into Physically Training Actors Like Tom Hardy Or Chris Hemsworth</a></span></p><p>Through all the struggles that all three Hemsworths may go through, they do come together to help each other make career choices.&nbsp;"We bounce ideas off each other all the time, and we're always going backwards and forwards about what we should be doing and what we're not doing," Luke explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think there is a stigma about three boys who are all actors in as far as, what is unique about each one? And how do I find what is unique about me? That is the question I ask a lot: How do I actually differentiate myself from them?"</p><p>"I am figuring it out as I go, but I'm very serious about doing good work," he concluded. If Luke continues to do what he does best, he'll find exactly what he wants to do.</p><h2 id=he-s-got-one-thing-chris-and-liam-don-t>He's Got One Thing Chris And Liam Don't</h2><p>While all three Hemsworths can come together for their mutual love of things like acting, surfing, philanthropy, veganism, and pranking, there's one thing that Luke is better at. Humor. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He claims he's the funniest Hemsworth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Hemsworth Recalls His Family's First Reaction When They Saw Him Play Thor</a></span></p><p>"Iâ€™m the short, dumb brother," he joked to Fox. He will concede&nbsp;that his brothers are better at navigating the business, however.</p><p>"In a lot of ways, Chris and Liam are definitely worlds ahead of me in terms of the entertainment industry and the experience it brings, which Iâ€™m more than happy to concede to," he said.</p><p>"Itâ€™s certainly not a bad thing, but there are also things that make it a bit harder for me because of the preconceptions that come along with me being a Hemsworth. Itâ€™s a strange world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if he does take his younger brothers advice, he said, "Yes, I take their advice, but as their older brother, a part of me also says, 'Oh, shut up.'"</p><p>Even though his career has taken off, Luke doesn't feel it's his time to shine because there's no competition. "Itâ€™s never been a competition thing. Itâ€™s about being able to do good work, and it always has been. I donâ€™t care where I sit in terms of hierarchy, box office takings, or any of that stuff.</p><p>"The reality is that thereâ€™s never a part of me that wishes I was doing something else. Itâ€™s a wonderful career choice, and I could never see myself sitting in an office and doing the 9 to 5 thing. Even when I was young, I never related to that kind of world."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luke's path is just different, period. "Iâ€™m quite happy to stick to that path and see where it goes. You canâ€™t ever force anything, and you have to deal with what comes to you as it comes."</p><p>Who knows, maybe Luke's stardom will skyrocket with a particularly great role that will come out of left field. Years back, no one expected Elizabeth Olsen to be more famous than the Olsen twins. Yet here we are, months off the success of WandaVision. If anything is clear about Luke Hemsworth, though, it's that he'll let his career happen naturally. Chris will soon leave the MCU, so there's a vacancy there if he wants it.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Candids Of The Hemsworth Brothers You're Going To Want To See</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijrqOVYrWmudKwpqusmGK6sMLInqpmmZ6ZerXCjKyfqK%2BjYrCpvsisZJqmlGK5qq3MZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-luke-hemsworth-jealous-of-his-brothers-movie-career.html&text=Is%20Luke%20Hemsworth%20Jealous%20Of%20His%20Brothers%20Movie%20Career%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-luke-hemsworth-jealous-of-his-brothers-movie-career.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-luke-hemsworth-jealous-of-his-brothers-movie-career.html&title=Is%20Luke%20Hemsworth%20Jealous%20Of%20His%20Brothers%20Movie%20Career%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-luke-hemsworth-jealous-of-his-brothers-movie-career.html&title=Is%20Luke%20Hemsworth%20Jealous%20Of%20His%20Brothers%20Movie%20Career%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-luke-hemsworth-jealous-of-his-brothers-movie-career.html&title=Is%20Luke%20Hemsworth%20Jealous%20Of%20His%20Brothers%20Movie%20Career%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-luke-hemsworth-jealous-of-his-brothers-movie-career.html&description=Is%20Luke%20Hemsworth%20Jealous%20Of%20His%20Brothers%20Movie%20Career%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kanye-west-facing-2-million-lawsuit-from-2020-presidential-campaign.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kanye West Facing $2 Million Lawsuit From 2020 Presidential Campaign">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-ask-for-booty-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to ask for booty pics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
