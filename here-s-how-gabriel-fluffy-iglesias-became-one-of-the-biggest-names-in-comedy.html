Settling in Long Beach, he quit his job to pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a comedian. After doing several small stints on television for seven years, the star received his big break with Comedy Central, which opened doors for Iglesias to venture into stand-up and acting. Today, he is one of the few comedians to have hosted sold-out shows at the biggest venues in the world and continues to <a href=#>entertain audiences through his OTT Specials</a>.</p><p>Gabriel Iglesias and his humor have appealed to the masses for its non-controversial material that remains clean and unaffected by global politics. Having entertained people of all walks of life and ages, Iglesias continues to wow crowds with his fresh comedy chops. Let’s look at how Gabriel Iglesias became one of the biggest names in comedy.</p><h2 id=shifting-toward-a-comedy-career>Shifting Toward A Comedy Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it seems that Gabriel Iglesias was always meant to be a stand-up comedian, he started his career as a cell phone operator at a local company before deciding to quit his job. Despite his family’s objections, Iglesias pursued the path, knowing he had the potential to achieve success. Before getting on stage in front of thousands of people, the star started with a Nickelodeon kids’ comedy sketch show, <i>All That</i>, starring in the first season with Amanda Bynes and Nick Cannon, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Known for his stunning voice work, he also landed roles in popular animated shows such as <i>Family Guy</i> and Disney’s <i>The Emperor's New School</i>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Zach Braff Became A Hollywood A-Lister</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Iglesias got to show off his comedic chops after participating in the <a href=#>reality competition for upcoming stand-up comedians</a>, <i>Last Comic Standing</i>, where he was in the final eight during the fourth season. Comedy Central picked up his DVD in 2009 for his special<i> Gabriel Iglesias: I'm Not Fat…I'm Fluffy</i> in 2009, which earned him his first shot of recognition for comedy. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, in 2011, Comedy Central also produced three seasons of his comedy program <i>Gabriel Iglesias Presents Stand Up Revolution</i>, which he hosted. His stand-up career also allowed him to parlay his talent in television shows and movies.</p><h2 id=television-and-a-stunning-netflix-deal>Television and a Stunning Netflix Deal</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gabriel Iglesias thrived on the screen, taking up roles in popular sitcoms and films. Some of his notable performances include as a recurring guest star in <i>Cristela</i> and a cameo on the hit ABC comedy show <i>Modern Family</i>. He also had small parts in feature films such as <i>A Haunted House 2 </i>and <i>Magic Mike</i>. In 2012, he had two reality shows on television: <i>Fluffy’s Food Adventures</i> and <i>Fluffy Breaks Even</i>. While Iglesias thrived, earning small roles and hosting reality shows, the comedian went through a dry spell in 2015 until Netflix came to the rescue with a staggering offer.</p><p>The comedian signed a multi-year Netflix deal that included the OTT platform releasing two of his comedy specials, a reality series, and more offers that had a multi-camera television show. His earnings, combined with the Netflix deal and being on the road for comedy specials, skyrocketed his fortune. Along with being featured as the Top 40 Comedians of 2018, he also landed in sixth place as the highest-paid comedian that year with $20.5 million, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. He reigned in the sixth position the following year with over $22 million in earnings through his specials and comedy tours around the globe.</p><h2 id=continuing-to-perform-at-sold-out-venues>Continuing To Perform At Sold-Out Venues</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many comedians are known to take breaks from their stand-up careers to focus on starring in movies and television shows. Headlining shows with fellow comedians, not many have achieved the feat of having sold-out concerts at some of the biggest venues in the world. Still, Gabriel Iglesias has focused on creating comedy for live audiences and the masses with new content. Iglesias has performed sold-out shows at the Madison Square Garden, Staples Center, and even the Sydney Opera House. <a href=#>Through his YouTube channel</a>, he has garnered over 370 million with a social media following of 14 million.</p><p>With his Netflix deal, Gabriel Iglesias participated in the 2022 <i>Netflix Is A Joke Festival</i> with some of the biggest names in comedy, including Kevin Hart and Dave Chapelle. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decider</a>, the 11-night festival observed that Iglesias became the first comedian to have sold-out Dodger Stadium with over 45,000 people who wanted to see his performance live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Through storytelling, characters, sound effects, and parodies, Gabriel Iglesias brings his experiences to life and grabs audiences' attention everywhere he goes. As one of the biggest comedians who remains grounded and continues to tour, he is all set to travel the world again in 2022 with <i>Fluffy Guy Is Back On Tour</i>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>These Are The 10 Most Expensive Palaces In The World</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Decider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6ditKKu0aKcpWWWocKnsthmoKCklai2or%2BMm5ycmZ2aerC6xGamn2WknbJursignp6rpGK7ornErGSipl2YvK6xw7Jm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-how-gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-became-one-of-the-biggest-names-in-comedy.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Gabriel%20%27Fluffy%27%20Iglesias%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Biggest%20Names%20In%20Comedy&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-how-gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-became-one-of-the-biggest-names-in-comedy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-became-one-of-the-biggest-names-in-comedy.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Gabriel%20%27Fluffy%27%20Iglesias%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Biggest%20Names%20In%20Comedy" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhere-s-how-gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-became-one-of-the-biggest-names-in-comedy.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Gabriel%20%27Fluffy%27%20Iglesias%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Biggest%20Names%20In%20Comedy" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-how-gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-became-one-of-the-biggest-names-in-comedy.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Gabriel%20%27Fluffy%27%20Iglesias%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Biggest%20Names%20In%20Comedy" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-how-gabriel-fluffy-iglesias-became-one-of-the-biggest-names-in-comedy.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Gabriel%20%27Fluffy%27%20Iglesias%20Became%20One%20Of%20The%20Biggest%20Names%20In%20Comedy" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./here-s-how-brian-austin-green-met-girlfriend-sharna-burgess.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heres How Brian Austin Green Met Girlfriend, Sharna Burgess">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./frankie-jonas-anwar-hadid-and-others-living-in-the-shadows-of-their-famous-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frankie Jonas, Anwar Hadid and Others Living In The Shadows Of Their Famous Siblings">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
