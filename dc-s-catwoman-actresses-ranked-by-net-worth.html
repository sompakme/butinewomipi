Starting in the '60s all the way through this year, there have been numerous actresses who have embodied Catwoman’s character. From the early actress Lee Meriwether to our current Zoë Kravitz, here are the last six decades of Catwomen ranked by their net worths.</p><h2 id=the-39-gotham-39-series-star-camren-bicondova-is-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The 'Gotham' Series Star Camren Bicondova Is Worth $1.5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2014, Fox premiered its dark and dramatic take on the Batman story with the television series Gotham. Camren Bicondova was hired to portray Catwoman in all five seasons of the show. Prior to this role, she only had three acting credits, and has added two more since the first season aired. Camren was in a spin-off short called Gotham Stories in 2016 where she reprised her role as Selina/Catwoman, bringing her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth to $1.5 million</a>.</p><h2 id=lee-meriwether-the-first-cinematic-catwoman-has-a-2-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lee Meriwether, The First Cinematic Catwoman, Has A $2 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>Lee Meriwether has lived an accomplished 86 years of life. Meriwether began her acting career in 1954, racking up an impressive 123 titles on her resume. The first Batman film came out in 1966, in which she portrayed The Catwoman, and she has since been constantly brought into the franchise. Lee has cameoed in Batman (the TV series) in 1967, Batman Vs. Two-Face in 2017, and Rise of the Catwoman in 2018. Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth rests at $2 milion</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eartha-kitt-39-s-net-worth-was-4-million-when-she-passed><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eartha Kitt's Net Worth Was $4 Million When She Passed</span></h2><p>Towards the end of the Batman TV series, in the last season, Eartha Kitt stepped in to take over the Catwoman role for Julie Newmar. Kitt unfortunately passed away in 2008, leaving behind a net worth of $4 million. Besides acting, in which she did from 1948 until the time she passed, she was also a well-known singer and widely loved for her portrayal of Yzma in <strong><a href=#>Disney’s</a></strong>The Emperor’s New Groove.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>'The Batman': Selina Kyle Aka Catwoman Has Nine Lives</a></span></p><h2 id=adrienne-barbeau-of-the-animated-series-is-worth-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Adrienne Barbeau Of The Animated Series Is Worth $5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adrienne Barbeau is a talented author, actress, singer, and Broadway performer. <a href=#>Her Catwoman portrayal was on Batman: The Animated Series</a>, from 1992-1995.

Kravitz broke through in franchise work in X-Men: First Class in 2011, although she had been hired on almost a dozen titles before then. Perhaps a little-known fact, Zoë actually reprised <a href=#>her role as Catwoman in this year’s The Batman</a> since she was first cast as the character in the animated The Lego Batman Movie.
